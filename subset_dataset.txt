I imagine there is a lot of drama behind the scenes. I know the coaches always come under a lot of heat for decisions to bench and trade players off. They probably can't afford for Brady to retire after they let Garoppolo go to San Fran.

Brady hasn't beaten up as badly as Manning was though, he hasn't had nearly as many injuries and just seems to be in better health in general. So maybe he won't burn out the same way he did.

Hey there, I found it pretty interesting that the Presidential runner-up became the Vice President until 1805	Hi. I thought that was awesome too. But now they have more choice in who they can work with. I thought it was awesome that Canadian law requires radio stations to play Canadian music 40 percent of the time.
Hi. I thought that was awesome too. But now they have more choice in who they can work with. I thought it was awesome that Canadian law requires radio stations to play Canadian music 40 percent of the time.	Yeah that was pretty interesting too. At least they are supporting their artists. The first couple articles were a bit frustrating - I feel like we're confusing politics with popular culture too much anymore.

Yes. We have. It seems as if every pop star has to get in on the political scene now.	Agreed, and we have our President and his staff/family getting into arguments, and every normal person wants the spotlight talking about politics
Agreed, and we have our President and his staff/family getting into arguments, and every normal person wants the spotlight talking about politics	I thought it was interesting that the President of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office. We need more artistic expression and less politics.

News casters always focus on that during elections. And who came up with the Donkey and Elephant thing?! I think we need a third party. There hasn't been a US President who was a Republican or Democrat since 1853.

I wouldnt argue with a third party either - speaking of consistency, its wild that Nixon and Bush have been so frequently on election tickets

I wouldnt argue with a third party either - speaking of consistency, its wild that Nixon and Bush have been so frequently on election tickets	I did not realize that either. I would have to see if that fact is really true with Wikipedia even thought I trust our requestor friends. I thought some of the facts about radios were wild. The fact that Jupitar has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio. I thought they were going to tie back radios to when earlier Presidents started to talk to the public on them but the fact section didn't.

It doesn't seem possible at first glance to be either must it has to be some sort of chemical properties/science thing. I would like to see that website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free.

Its crazy that a finnish station broadcasts in classical latin too - you wouldnt think too many people would speak latin	I was really surprised at that time. Latin is always advertised as being a 'dead language.' My old teacher said that people are not even certain how to pronounce it. But, if you think about it, scientists 'speak it' because of how they categorize everything. I guess those Finnish people want to make sure that people can practice their Latin.

He proves that there is no bad publicity. Guatemala seems to have a good idea about the presidency. Close relatives of former presidents cannot legally run for president. That might allow new blood into the race in the US. The bigger problem is money in politics though.

He was until he was injured. He took so many AP tests in high school that he entered college as a junior. That's pretty impressive.	Yeah, that is impressive, to my understanding, it seems like education comes second to sports for these great athletes, but not the case for Alex Smith and also for Baker Mayfield.

I live with someone who is hearing impaired so I might be able to answer that question, I would think that because hearing aid technology is pretty advanced these days and I'd imagine the deaf quarterback would have hearing aids on probably to prevent that or maybe the coach can intercom them through their headsets to give them a heads up?

Very good questions. I've never seen a left handed QB so I'm not sure. I would be very curious to see.	Yeah! Because I have heard that left handed pitchers in NBL are prized possession, maybe it holds true for quarterbacks or maybe they make more than other NFL players since the average earnings of an engineer is higher than the earnings of an NFL player.

Yeah agreed. For some reason he decided to ridicule France about their performance in WWI and WWII... and accused Macron of forming a European army to attack the US...	I think Trump had, some time ago, criticized NATO and how much the US pays into NATO. Here is a member nation saying they need a bigger role. The guy makes no sense at times.

Right on. Instead we have titter wars started for small reasons. It does entertain the voters however.	Yeah, it's unfortunate that voters are so easily swayed by what entertains them.

I wish the states had more room to experiment with various policies without the feds or supreme court coming in an making law for the entire nation. If texas wants open carry of automatic weapons, and Massachusetts wants to try single-payer healthcare, then let them, and let people come and go.

The powers vary with the constitution of the country. Generally though, I expect them to have money. The three wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.

There's a book called "The Ultimate Treasure Hunt" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.

For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.
