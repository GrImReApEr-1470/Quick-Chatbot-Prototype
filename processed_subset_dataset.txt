Yes, I sometimes do. Do you? I hear Facebook is mentioned in lots of divorce filings nowadays. <|endoftext|> Yes sadly. It's a bad thing for that. Burger King once ran a promotion where if you unfriended 10 people on Facebook you would get a free whopper. Some of those people who had to file divorce because of it should have taken them up on their offer. They could have gotten a free whopper! <|endoftext|>

Facebook is so popular that over a quarter of Americans use it as their main news source! <|endoftext|>
I think so! Facebook is so popular that over a quarter of Americans use it as their main news source! <|endoftext|> That's crazy I think. Don't you? I see so much trash on there or biased stories. Facebook is valued at over 104 billion dollars now! Wow. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy I think. Don't you? I see so much trash on there or biased stories. Facebook is valued at over 104 billion dollars now! Wow. <|endoftext|> It was hard enough to believe some of the news on TV, but I agree, the stuff you can read on Facebook is sometimes absurd! <|endoftext|>
It was hard enough to believe some of the news on TV, but I agree, the stuff you can read on Facebook is sometimes absurd! <|endoftext|> Yes. Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005. Bad move on their part. <|endoftext|>
Yes. Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005. Bad move on their part. <|endoftext|> That's interesting because Facebook is blue like the Democrat party and Myspace was Red like Republicans and I heard that Democrats are projected to dominate in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting because Facebook is blue like the Democrat party and Myspace was Red like Republicans and I heard that Democrats are projected to dominate in the future. <|endoftext|> I never noticed that about the colors. Mark Zuckerburg must be a democrat because he made Facebook primarily blue because he suffers from red-green colorblindness. lol <|endoftext|>
I never noticed that about the colors. Mark Zuckerburg must be a democrat because he made Facebook primarily blue because he suffers from red-green colorblindness. lol <|endoftext|> Maybe it was a happy consequence for him and Facebook. I heard that red was once a more likable color for people but now it's blue. Something about the sub-conscience. <|endoftext|>
Maybe it was a happy consequence for him and Facebook. I heard that red was once a more likable color for people but now it's blue. Something about the sub-conscience. <|endoftext|> That's interesting! Do you watch much television? Ever a fan of "That 70s show?" <|endoftext|>

I have watched that 70's show on TV. It was one of my favorite shows to watch when it came out! Do you like it, too? <|endoftext|> I loved it. I recently found out that they made a UK version of it called "Days Like These". They only made 10 episodes. You can find them on Youtube. It's funny because the characters names are the same, they dress the same, and have the same quirks and personalities as the 70s show characters. Even the different car scenes at the beginning are the same just with different music. <|endoftext|>

That's pretty funny! I wonder if the show would have included Facebook if it was as out at the time? Can you imagine cut-scenes to the characters Facebook walls? <|endoftext|> lol I never thought of that. That would be neat! I can't believe how popular Pokemon is. There are over 750 episodes.

Hmm...I don't know. Interesting. Facebook's like button is illegal in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. I don't know why though. <|endoftext|> I thought besides the like button that Facebook also used to have an unlike button like Youtube? <|endoftext|>
I thought besides the like button that Facebook also used to have an unlike button like Youtube? <|endoftext|> You know what? You're right! They did have a dislike. Maybe they got rid of it due to advertisers demands because they make most of their revenue from ads that appear on the screen? <|endoftext|>
You know what? You're right! They did have a dislike. Maybe they got rid of it due to advertisers demands because they make most of their revenue from ads that appear on the screen? <|endoftext|> I heard that instead of that they give the Facebook users the option of putting in an emoji. I wonder if it's all because they don't want people to be offended? <|endoftext|>
I heard that instead of that they give the Facebook users the option of putting in an emoji. I wonder if it's all because they don't want people to be offended? <|endoftext|> I would say that you're probably correct. It was nice chatting with you! <|endoftext|>

Good morning, were you aware that Google's self driving cars have an "aggressive" mode? Sounds like a disaster in the making, to me. <|endoftext|> I didn't know that. Sounds dangerous to me! We've come along way since the modern car was invented by Karl Benz in 1886. <|endoftext|>
I didn't know that. Sounds dangerous to me! We've come along way since the modern car was invented by Karl Benz in 1886. <|endoftext|> For far too long, I thought Henry Ford invented the car, lol.

Wow, that's interesting and it's so cold in Ohio, too! Did you know the Cadillac is named after French explorer, Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac, who founded Detroit? <|endoftext|> I did, I've been to his home on Bell Island.

I did, I've been to his home on Bell Island. It's funny that Audi had to invent a new horn, for the Indian Market. <|endoftext|> Didn't know that tidbit of info, but I do know it's legal in South Africa to equip your car with flamethrowers to prevent carjacking. <|endoftext|>
Didn't know that tidbit of info, but I do know it's legal in South Africa to equip your car with flamethrowers to prevent carjacking. <|endoftext|> That is cool. I would love to find a barn full of classic cars, like that guy in New York. <|endoftext|>

You and me both, we'd be rich! Hard to believe the Mcdonald's drive thru has only been in existence since 1975, though. <|endoftext|> I wouldn't know, I was born after that. I cant believe so many people don't realize that the fuel gauge will tell you which side your gas tank is on. <|endoftext|>

No, but that doesn't surprise me. I hear there is one Simpsons episode where Bart is neither mentioned nor appears. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have not, as I don't watch the simpsons. I would have liked to seen the one where Daniel Radcliffe was voicing Edward Cullen. <|endoftext|>
I have not, as I don't watch the simpsons. I would have liked to seen the one where Daniel Radcliffe was voicing Edward Cullen. <|endoftext|> Yeah, that would have been awesome.

Hi! Do you own a compact car, crossover SUV, SUV, or what type of car do you own? <|endoftext|> I love Cadillacs and would like to own one of those! Never knew until recently they were named after the founder of Detroit - French explorer Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac! What about you? <|endoftext|>
I love Cadillacs and would like to own one of those! Never knew until recently they were named after the founder of Detroit - French explorer Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac! What about you? <|endoftext|> I like Cadillacs as well and would be proud to take it to the drive thru of my favorite fast food restaurants like Chic-Fil-A or McDonald's, they were the ones who started the drive-thru in order to accommodate soldiers who weren't able to get out of their cars while wearing their uniforms. <|endoftext|>

I assumed drive-thrus were always apart of fast food chains. Wonder when the first drive-thru was introduced, if cars still had wooden trunks in the back as they used to have, hence where the name "trunk" came from. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy, Isn't it? I assumed drive-thrus were always apart of fast food chains. Wonder when the first drive-thru was introduced, if cars still had wooden trunks in the back as they used to have, hence where the name "trunk" came from. <|endoftext|> They were introduced in 1975 which seems a bit late to me, imagine if it was patented or trademarked, then Jann Mardenborough wouldn't have to become a professional race car driver by beating 90K other people in a video game! <|endoftext|>
They were introduced in 1975 which seems a bit late to me, imagine if it was patented or trademarked, then Jann Mardenborough wouldn't have to become a professional race car driver by beating 90K other people in a video game! <|endoftext|> Ha! No kidding. That takes real talent to be able to do both! If Jann ever races in south Africa, let's hope he has a flamethrower in his car to keep carjackers away! <|endoftext|>
Ha! No kidding. That takes real talent to be able to do both! If Jann ever races in south Africa, let's hope he has a flamethrower in his car to keep carjackers away! <|endoftext|> I imagine it could be quite fun and liberating to press the "launch" buttons to activate those flamethrowers, it's the equivalent of a Turbo button in the video game Gran Turismo that Jan plays. <|endoftext|>
I imagine it could be quite fun and liberating to press the "launch" buttons to activate those flamethrowers, it's the equivalent of a Turbo button in the video game Gran Turismo that Jan plays. <|endoftext|> Ha! I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary about Jann on the tele one day! Speaking of tv, were you a fan of 70's Show? I heard it was remade in the UK but cancelled literally 10 episodes in.

Never saw much of it but I do know that Ashton Kutcher got his claim to fame from that show, you think the reason it was cancelled was because there weren't any actors or actresses worth gushing over? <|endoftext|> Maybe so?

Maybe so? Weird it was cancelled 10 episodes in yet a show like Pokemon has over 750 episodes! <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen an episode of pokemon? I haven't, even though there's that many episodes! That's enough to last for 16 years if you played 50 of them every season. <|endoftext|>
Have you ever seen an episode of pokemon? I haven't, even though there's that many episodes! That's enough to last for 16 years if you played 50 of them every season. <|endoftext|> It's a great show for kids although I haven't seen too many. No where near 750. Ha! I prefer South Park. Speaking of which, did you know the Simpson's crew actually sent the South Park producers flowers after they aired the Family Guy episode? <|endoftext|>
It's a great show for kids although I haven't seen too many. No where near 750. Ha! I prefer South Park. Speaking of which, did you know the Simpson's crew actually sent the South Park producers flowers after they aired the Family Guy episode? <|endoftext|> That's very nice of them, I wonder if that happened after the episodes where its the only one where Bart didn't appear and isn't even mentioned, did they foresee an ending in sight? <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of them, I wonder if that happened after the episodes where its the only one where Bart didn't appear and isn't even mentioned, did they foresee an ending in sight? <|endoftext|> I'm honestly not sure. It's crazy Bart never appeared nor was mentioned in an episode, right? Wonder what episode that was? Maybe I can post about it on Facebook and get an answer! Speaking of Facebook, it's crazy how far it's come since it was launched on Feb 4th, 2004! <|endoftext|>
I'm honestly not sure. It's crazy Bart never appeared nor was mentioned in an episode, right? Wonder what episode that was? Maybe I can post about it on Facebook and get an answer! Speaking of Facebook, it's crazy how far it's come since it was launched on Feb 4th, 2004! <|endoftext|> You can definitely get an answer if you post it, there are some very loyal fans of the show, I would've never noticed Bart never appeared. Did you know how Facebook came to be and how it was developed? <|endoftext|>
You can definitely get an answer if you post it, there are some very loyal fans of the show, I would've never noticed Bart never appeared.

And boy did it grow! <|endoftext|>
I know Mark Zuckerberg developed it with help from a few roommates at Harvard and it grew from there... And boy did it grow! <|endoftext|> Yeah, definitely makes me think about the things I "didn't" accomplish while I was stuck in my dorm room with roommates back in the day. I wonder how MySpace feels now for turning down Facebook for a discounted rate of $75 million. How would you feel? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, definitely makes me think about the things I "didn't" accomplish while I was stuck in my dorm room with roommates back in the day. I wonder how MySpace feels now for turning down Facebook for a discounted rate of $75 million. How would you feel? <|endoftext|> Especially knowing MySpace is nothing now, I would be depressed. So sad to think where MySpace would be today had they opted to buy the $104 billion dollar company. <|endoftext|>
Especially knowing MySpace is nothing now, I would be depressed. So sad to think where MySpace would be today had they opted to buy the $104 billion dollar company. <|endoftext|> My guess is they would be a venture company investing billions in other startup companies in hopes of find their next payoff like "Facebook", but maybe if they ran a promotion like what Burger King once did where if you unfriended 10 people, you'd get a Free Whopper, maybe there's still some hope with great marketing. <|endoftext|>

Not until recently but apparently 61% of our global population still lack safe sanitation in 2015. I think that is pretty bad. <|endoftext|> I definitely agree that is bad. It seems like progress had been really hard to achieve, because that percentage is certainly high! <|endoftext|>
I definitely agree that is bad. It seems like progress had been really hard to achieve, because that percentage is certainly high! <|endoftext|> Well, most of it is concentrated in South Asia, rural Africa, and India. In 2014 India's Prime Minister began the Clean India Mission to install 111 million household toilets by the end of 2019. That estimated cost is about $20 billion. <|endoftext|>
Well, most of it is concentrated in South Asia, rural Africa, and India. In 2014 India's Prime Minister began the Clean India Mission to install 111 million household toilets by the end of 2019. That estimated cost is about $20 billion. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great mission to do. That mission includes communicating hygiene awareness especially toward rural communities. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great mission to do. That mission includes communicating hygiene awareness especially toward rural communities. <|endoftext|> Yes, and especially toward women. The women that consume mass media information through newspapers, TV, or radio are more likely to install private toilets in their households. This relays to them the high risks of open defecation. <|endoftext|>
Yes, and especially toward women. The women that consume mass media information through newspapers, TV, or radio are more likely to install private toilets in their households. This relays to them the high risks of open defecation. <|endoftext|> That is good because that should make those areas have a more safely managed toilets to remove the waste in a sanitary manner! <|endoftext|>
That is good because that should make those areas have a more safely managed toilets to remove the waste in a sanitary manner! <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree. Not to mention the dangers of waterborne disease. Or the fact that women and girls are at a higher risk of violence and stress when practicing open defecation after sunset. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree. Not to mention the dangers of waterborne disease. Or the fact that women and girls are at a higher risk of violence and stress when practicing open defecation after sunset. <|endoftext|> That's too bad, because those women are probably the main caregivers to the children also. Which due to that are way more susceptible to sanitation-related diseases. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, because those women are probably the main caregivers to the children also. Which due to that are way more susceptible to sanitation-related diseases. <|endoftext|> Exactly. Since the women are usually the primary caregivers to the kids, they have a higher stake in the burdens of poor sanitation practices because it affects them more. <|endoftext|>
Exactly. Since the women are usually the primary caregivers to the kids, they have a higher stake in the burdens of poor sanitation practices because it affects them more. <|endoftext|> Well luckily with these "safely managed toilets," they can provide other benefits which include more privacy and reduced exposure to physical and sexual violence. <|endoftext|>
Well luckily with these "safely managed toilets," they can provide other benefits which include more privacy and reduced exposure to physical and sexual violence. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree. That also is why it makes sense for the women to take a bigger leadership role in addressing these very important sanitation issues. Although increasing the number of toilets and improving their quality is important, the larger challenge is to make sure that they are actually used. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree. That also is why it makes sense for the women to take a bigger leadership role in addressing these very important sanitation issues. Although increasing the number of toilets and improving their quality is important, the larger challenge is to make sure that they are actually used. <|endoftext|> Yes that is a challenge still. Women are more affected in what consequences can happen because they are at higher risk. <|endoftext|>
Yes that is a challenge still. Women are more affected in what consequences can happen because they are at higher risk. <|endoftext|> In India they have public toilets in the slum areas known as community toilet complexes. But, many people in Delhi's slums don't use them according to a survey of 810 households there. <|endoftext|>

But, many people in Delhi's slums don't use them according to a survey of 810 households there. <|endoftext|> Private toilet ownership must be rare there.

Private toilet ownership must be rare there. What is intriguing though, is while many respondents acknowledged that open defecation is embarrassing and not healthy, they still find public places to defecate or use their work toilet <|endoftext|> Boy, I can't imagine waiting until I got to work to go to the bathroom. How awful is that? I've read surveys that reveal that more interactions among community member could be an important motivator to get people to use public toilets because these kind of networks help spread norms that discourage the practice of open defecation. <|endoftext|>

That is good about those networks! Speaking of networks, I watch TV sometimes, and that would be a good area to help communities if capable of having a TV. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree that would help spread the news but people that live in the slums probably don't have access to TV or even radio. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree that would help spread the news but people that live in the slums probably don't have access to TV or even radio. <|endoftext|> True, if that is the case maybe someone can use a radio to engage the community. <|endoftext|>
True, if that is the case maybe someone can use a radio to engage the community. <|endoftext|> The poverty is rampant though that might be very hard to pull off. The best they can hope for is probably word-of-mouth networks to help educate these people to help solve their own disease problems like diarrhea which is the leading cause of child mortality in the world. <|endoftext|>

They would have to score every 4 minutes or something like that. That's crazy! <|endoftext|> The other team didn't get off the bench. Did you know in the 60's the top bowler's made twice as much as the top football players? <|endoftext|>
The other team didn't get off the bench. Did you know in the 60's the top bowler's made twice as much as the top football players? <|endoftext|> That's crazy to think how the tides have turned.

I've never seen him play, but I know who he is. Do you have a favorite team? <|endoftext|> I actually like the Patriots. I think it's a bit annoying though that Brady seems to be "above" the team in some ways. For example. he's skipped out on voluntary workouts with the team, and was on a yacht in Monaco instead. Pretty lame, agree? <|endoftext|>

I suspect he takes as many liberties as he can get away with. Do you think his actions are looked at negatively by his teammates? <|endoftext|> I think so, yes, it's caused problems. One of the former defensive ends, Cassius Marsh, has been pretty outspoken about being unhappy there. <|endoftext|>

Yeah, how about those salaries! It makes me sad that we pay athletes more than our teachers. <|endoftext|> The salaries are incredible! Of course, most football players don't work for that many years, so those are lifetime earning for them. Still a ton of money.

How much does the coach earn, if you know? <|endoftext|> Oh, I have no idea, but I think they do pretty well. I'm sure there are bonuses for how well the team does, how they do in playoffs, and things like that. <|endoftext|>

Now, six. Glad to see that his TE, Rob Gronkowski, won MVP this year. Brady's already won that honor in 4 other SB wins. Ever see Brady pass to Gronkowski? <|endoftext|> No. I have to say he assumes the leading role on a football team well. <|endoftext|>
No. I have to say he assumes the leading role on a football team well. <|endoftext|> Brady. You bet. Gronkowski, with his long brown beard, is pretty distinctive, too. Brady passes to him 19% of the time, which is a lot. No question Brady is a great team leader. Coach Belichick, too. <|endoftext|>

I guess though that the Patriots wouldn't be very negatively affected by his absence, because they have other good players that rank near his ability. <|endoftext|> Agreed. Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola come to mind. Brady can target other players, too. Deep offensive line! <|endoftext|>
Agreed. Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola come to mind. Brady can target other players, too. Deep offensive line! <|endoftext|> Yeah. Well thanks for the conversation. Have a good day. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. Well thanks for the conversation. Have a good day. <|endoftext|> You bet. Hope you enjoy your fav sports! <|endoftext|>
You bet. Hope you enjoy your fav sports! <|endoftext|> Hi. Do you play or watch football? <|endoftext|>
Hi. Do you play or watch football? <|endoftext|> Hi! I love to watch football! I wish I could have seen Georgia Tech set the highest score record over Cumberland by beating them 222-0 back in 1916 though. I bet that was fun to watch. Do you watch football as well? <|endoftext|>
Hi! I love to watch football! I wish I could have seen Georgia Tech set the highest score record over Cumberland by beating them 222-0 back in 1916 though. I bet that was fun to watch. Do you watch football as well? <|endoftext|> On the contrary, I would find it boring. Cumberland players might be asleep while playing football. <|endoftext|>
On the contrary, I would find it boring. Cumberland players might be asleep while playing football. <|endoftext|> You know, perhaps if Cumberland had to sit in a pink lockerroom like the visiting football team's locker room at the University of Iowa, they may have been a little more motivated. Ha! <|endoftext|>
You know, perhaps if Cumberland had to sit in a pink lockerroom like the visiting football team's locker room at the University of Iowa, they may have been a little more motivated. Ha! <|endoftext|> That was funny. Yes, I heard about the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting teams. <|endoftext|>
That was funny. Yes, I heard about the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting teams. <|endoftext|> Did you also hear that the top bowlers made double what the top football players made back in the 1960s? That's kind of sad really considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is. <|endoftext|>
Did you also hear that the top bowlers made double what the top football players made back in the 1960s? That's kind of sad really considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is. <|endoftext|> I agree with you. Things had changed considerably though. Bowlers make pennies now compared to professional football players. <|endoftext|>
I agree with you. Things had changed considerably though. Bowlers make pennies now compared to professional football players. <|endoftext|> Indeed they do and rightfully so, in my opinion. Just think if Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career played in the 60s. He would have been ripped off and that's so wrong! <|endoftext|>
Indeed they do and rightfully so, in my opinion. Just think if Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career played in the 60s. He would have been ripped off and that's so wrong! <|endoftext|> Yes, it would be wrong. I like Green-Ellis. He is a talented football player. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it would be wrong. I like Green-Ellis. He is a talented football player. <|endoftext|> Indeed he is! Do you also like Kellan Moore? It's crazy to think he's the only left handed QB in the entire league! <|endoftext|>
Indeed he is! Do you also like Kellan Moore? It's crazy to think he's the only left handed QB in the entire league! <|endoftext|> That was an interesting fact (about Kellan Moore). Are you familiar with Tom Brady? <|endoftext|>
That was an interesting fact (about Kellan Moore). Are you familiar with Tom Brady? <|endoftext|> I am and love Brady. Although I still can't believe his JV high team refused to start him when he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season. I bet his old coach still kicks himself to this day over that mistake! Are you a fan of Brady? <|endoftext|>
I am and love Brady. Although I still can't believe his JV high team refused to start him when he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season. I bet his old coach still kicks himself to this day over that mistake! Are you a fan of Brady? <|endoftext|> I'm sure he does not get free football games tickets from Tom Brady. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he does not get free football games tickets from Tom Brady. <|endoftext|> No kidding! Ha! Speaking of Brady, I wonder what his wife Gisele does? I ask because she makes over double what he makes, which must be a lot! <|endoftext|>
No kidding! Ha! Speaking of Brady, I wonder what his wife Gisele does? I ask because she makes over double what he makes, which must be a lot! <|endoftext|> I cannot believe that she makes more than he does - perhaps the article was written when Tom Brady was not well known. What does she do? <|endoftext|>
I cannot believe that she makes more than he does - perhaps the article was written when Tom Brady was not well known. What does she do? <|endoftext|> That's a good question. She is obviously loaded and they aren't hurting for money. Ha! But to me, I think the fact that Brady has never eaten a strawberry is even more bizarre. It's like, how has he never eaten a strawberry? Ha! <|endoftext|>
That's a good question. She is obviously loaded and they aren't hurting for money. Ha! But to me, I think the fact that Brady has never eaten a strawberry is even more bizarre. It's like, how has he never eaten a strawberry? Ha! <|endoftext|> That was strange. He should have tried at least once and could then decide not to like it. <|endoftext|>
That was strange. He should have tried at least once and could then decide not to like it. <|endoftext|> Exactly. But He is a 4 time Super Bowl MVP winner, 3 time league MVP winner and is the only QB to ever reach 200 regular season wins so I guess he can eat whatever he so desires. Ha! <|endoftext|>
Exactly. But He is a 4 time Super Bowl MVP winner, 3 time league MVP winner and is the only QB to ever reach 200 regular season wins so I guess he can eat whatever he so desires. Ha! <|endoftext|> You are right. I heard that Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week, even though there was no sign of injury. Do you know why? <|endoftext|>
You are right. I heard that Bill Belichick lists Tom Brady on the injury report every week, even though there was no sign of injury. Do you know why? <|endoftext|> I honestly don't but it's worth finding out why as that is strange! I do know, however, that Belichick and Brady have both either won or lost the Super Bowl by 3 to 4 points in 6 tries! <|endoftext|>
I honestly don't but it's worth finding out why as that is strange! I do know, however, that Belichick and Brady have both either won or lost the Super Bowl by 3 to 4 points in 6 tries! <|endoftext|> That was an interesting fact. You know quite a lot about football. <|endoftext|>
That was an interesting fact. You know quite a lot about football. <|endoftext|> I just love everything about it! Although honestly, now I don't think I could watch a game without the yellow first down line that ESPN created and won an Emmy for. It has spoiled me! Ha! Well it was nice chatting with you today! Have a great day, friend! <|endoftext|>
I just love everything about it! Although honestly, now I don't think I could watch a game without the yellow first down line that ESPN created and won an Emmy for. It has spoiled me! Ha!

Thank you for the info about ESPN and the yellow first down line. Have a great day to you too! <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>
Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm good how about yourself? Do you like football? <|endoftext|>
I'm good how about yourself? Do you like football? <|endoftext|> I love football, I am a big Eagles fan, still excited about the superbowl win over the Patriots! <|endoftext|>
I love football, I am a big Eagles fan, still excited about the superbowl win over the Patriots! <|endoftext|> Cool, I'm not a big fan but I do tend to watch sometimes, especially the Superbowl. It is interesting that Baker Mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive gamer. <|endoftext|>
Cool, I'm not a big fan but I do tend to watch sometimes, especially the Superbowl. It is interesting that Baker Mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive gamer. <|endoftext|> I have heard that as well, I know he was very good at Halo! <|endoftext|>
I have heard that as well, I know he was very good at Halo! <|endoftext|> Oh yes, he claimed he could beat anyone at halo 3 at the University of Oklahoma! <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, he claimed he could beat anyone at halo 3 at the University of Oklahoma! <|endoftext|> I believe that, if he is good enough he could have made a living from it! <|endoftext|>
I believe that, if he is good enough he could have made a living from it! <|endoftext|> Yes I agree. I heard the highest score ever in football was 222-0 in 1916. Wow that is a crazy score. <|endoftext|>
Yes I agree. I heard the highest score ever in football was 222-0 in 1916. Wow that is a crazy score. <|endoftext|> That was a college game right? I had seen a video about that before <|endoftext|>
That was a college game right? I had seen a video about that before <|endoftext|> Yes Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland. Interesting game i bet. <|endoftext|>
Yes Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland. Interesting game i bet. <|endoftext|> I bet it was almost comical in how lopsided it was, college is always like that, but not to that extent <|endoftext|>
I bet it was almost comical in how lopsided it was, college is always like that, but not to that extent <|endoftext|> Yeah. Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink, on the visiting teams side of course? <|endoftext|>
Yeah. Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink, on the visiting teams side of course? <|endoftext|> I did not know that, that is hilarious, I wonder if their home record shows that it makes any type of difference? <|endoftext|>
I did not know that, that is hilarious, I wonder if their home record shows that it makes any type of difference? <|endoftext|> I'm curious to that as well, would pink paint really make a difference in play? <|endoftext|>
I'm curious to that as well, would pink paint really make a difference in play? <|endoftext|> Maybe it actually makes them more upset and angry! <|endoftext|>
Maybe it actually makes them more upset and angry! <|endoftext|> Yes which would be doing the opposite of their intentions, too funny. Alex Smith received his bachelor's degree in only two years, I wish I could do the same. <|endoftext|>
Yes which would be doing the opposite of their intentions, too funny. Alex Smith received his bachelor's degree in only two years, I wish I could do the same. <|endoftext|> I do too, he is a very bright person! QBs have to be very smart <|endoftext|>
I do too, he is a very bright person! QBs have to be very smart <|endoftext|> I agree with that, the game is centered around the importance of the QBs plays. They are the leaders of the offensive team after all. <|endoftext|>
I agree with that, the game is centered around the importance of the QBs plays. They are the leaders of the offensive team after all. <|endoftext|> They are still sort of underpaid in my opinion. I think that it is crazy that bowlers used to make more than football players! <|endoftext|>
They are still sort of underpaid in my opinion. I think that it is crazy that bowlers used to make more than football players! <|endoftext|> Wow, that is new to me. Bowling is so much easier to play I would think. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is new to me. Bowling is so much easier to play I would think. <|endoftext|> I think so too, or at the very least it is certainly safer! <|endoftext|>
I think so too, or at the very least it is certainly safer! <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? Do you follow football? <|endoftext|>
Hi, how are you? Do you follow football? <|endoftext|> Hey Friend, I really don't follow myself, but my whole family does, so I know a little about it. I grew up in New England so they're all Patriots fans. <|endoftext|>
Hey Friend, I really don't follow myself, but my whole family does, so I know a little about it. I grew up in New England so they're all Patriots fans. <|endoftext|> The Patriots really are the team to beat. I remember way back when, they were terrible. Now TB and Bill are the best. <|endoftext|>
The Patriots really are the team to beat. I remember way back when, they were terrible. Now TB and Bill are the best. <|endoftext|> Right, they really brought that team together. Tom Brady is really pretty special. I didn't realize he was that old, I guess. Not that 41 is old, but for a footballer.. <|endoftext|>
Right, they really brought that team together. Tom Brady is really pretty special. I didn't realize he was that old, I guess. Not that 41 is old, but for a footballer.. <|endoftext|> He must be getting close to retirement. I can't imagine money is an issue. Nor is legacy. <|endoftext|>
He must be getting close to retirement. I can't imagine money is an issue. Nor is legacy. <|endoftext|> I would imagine he must be. I think the Patriots are kind of seeing the end of an era not. Belichick is 66, Rob Gronkowski is pondering hanging up his hat it sounds like. Maybe if they had won the superbowl against the eagles it would have been different. <|endoftext|>
I would imagine he must be. I think the Patriots are kind of seeing the end of an era not. Belichick is 66, Rob Gronkowski is pondering hanging up his hat it sounds like. Maybe if they had won the superbowl against the eagles it would have been different. <|endoftext|> The sport takes its toll on the body and mind. No reason to keep going if you're not going to be able to enjoy the money. <|endoftext|>
The sport takes its toll on the body and mind. No reason to keep going if you're not going to be able to enjoy the money. <|endoftext|> Oh definitely. You can only get bashed in the brain box so many times before it starts to really effect you. If it weren't for the enormous toll they put on their bodies I would feel their salaries were disgusting. But some of them probably don't have many options after retirement. <|endoftext|>
Oh definitely. You can only get bashed in the brain box so many times before it starts to really effect you. If it weren't for the enormous toll they put on their bodies I would feel their salaries were disgusting. But some of them probably don't have many options after retirement. <|endoftext|> The money that the game attracts for the owners and the advertisers justifies the salaries. They wouldn't get paid unless others could make money off it. <|endoftext|>
The money that the game attracts for the owners and the advertisers justifies the salaries. They wouldn't get paid unless others could make money off it. <|endoftext|> I imagine there is a lot of drama behind the scenes. I know the coaches always come under a lot of heat for decisions to bench and trade players off. They probably can't afford for Brady to retire after they let Garoppolo go to San Fran. <|endoftext|>
I imagine there is a lot of drama behind the scenes. I know the coaches always come under a lot of heat for decisions to bench and trade players off. They probably can't afford for Brady to retire after they let Garoppolo go to San Fran. <|endoftext|> Brady can keep going only for so long. What if he gets injured? They need a backup plan. I'm sure Bill has something up his sleeve. <|endoftext|>
Brady can keep going only for so long. What if he gets injured? They need a backup plan. I'm sure Bill has something up his sleeve. <|endoftext|> I'm sure he does. But for now, he shows no intention of leaving. He's still breaking records on a regular basis, he's the oldest player to be awarded MVP for the super bowl game, I think. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he does. But for now, he shows no intention of leaving. He's still breaking records on a regular basis, he's the oldest player to be awarded MVP for the super bowl game, I think. <|endoftext|> That's astounding. The guy really exceeded all expectations. When he was young, he was not recognized for his potential. <|endoftext|>
That's astounding. The guy really exceeded all expectations. When he was young, he was not recognized for his potential. <|endoftext|> He really did. I wonder if he'll turn out to be like Peyton Manning, who was just aces until all of a sudden he wasn't anymore and they retired him. He went downhill like the drop of a hat. <|endoftext|>
He really did. I wonder if he'll turn out to be like Peyton Manning, who was just aces until all of a sudden he wasn't anymore and they retired him. He went downhill like the drop of a hat. <|endoftext|> I think there comes a day when you just can't compete at the pro level. It's tough. New guys come in, the game changes, and no amount of conditioning can change that. <|endoftext|>
I think there comes a day when you just can't compete at the pro level. It's tough. New guys come in, the game changes, and no amount of conditioning can change that. <|endoftext|> Definitely. Brady hasn't beaten up as badly as Manning was though, he hasn't had nearly as many injuries and just seems to be in better health in general. So maybe he won't burn out the same way he did. There is speculation that he still has several seasons left in him. It must be exhausting at that age. <|endoftext|>
Definitely. Brady hasn't beaten up as badly as Manning was though, he hasn't had nearly as many injuries and just seems to be in better health in general. So maybe he won't burn out the same way he did. There is speculation that he still has several seasons left in him. It must be exhausting at that age. <|endoftext|> I think it's unwise to bank on a player that age. A team has got to develop new talent. Maybe they can get someone through trades, but there is so much to learn. <|endoftext|>
I think it's unwise to bank on a player that age. A team has got to develop new talent. Maybe they can get someone through trades, but there is so much to learn. <|endoftext|> It will be interesting to see what they do. , maybe McDaniels will stay instead of going to coach the colts. Gronkowski's future seems unsure. He's only 29 but has had a number of injuries. <|endoftext|>
It will be interesting to see what they do. , maybe McDaniels will stay instead of going to coach the colts. Gronkowski's future seems unsure. He's only 29 but has had a number of injuries. <|endoftext|> I think these guys have to consider life after football. They will retire and will need to use that body later on. <|endoftext|>
I think these guys have to consider life after football. They will retire and will need to use that body later on. <|endoftext|> I think so too, I think he and his wife Gisele have a few kids, and she makes more money even than he does. I would want to settle down and enjoy life before I get too old and sore. <|endoftext|>
I think so too, I think he and his wife Gisele have a few kids, and she makes more money even than he does. I would want to settle down and enjoy life before I get too old and sore. <|endoftext|> Enjoy time with your kids. He can coach, too. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting! <|endoftext|>

I enjoy playing football and have a passing knowledge of the sport <|endoftext|> Nice. Who is your favorite team? <|endoftext|>
Nice. Who is your favorite team? <|endoftext|> I don't have a particular favorite team, but I prefer specific players like the QB Tom Brady. I tend to like QB since they are the core of any offense <|endoftext|>
I don't have a particular favorite team, but I prefer specific players like the QB Tom Brady. I tend to like QB since they are the core of any offense <|endoftext|> Me too! Did you know tom brady didn't start on his HS team? And he has 6 super bowl championships! <|endoftext|>
Me too! Did you know tom brady didn't start on his HS team? And he has 6 super bowl championships! <|endoftext|> I wonder if the coach hated tom brady to never play his during hs despite having the worst season in the schools history <|endoftext|>
I wonder if the coach hated tom brady to never play his during hs despite having the worst season in the schools history <|endoftext|> If he hated him, he would have put him in to get hit over and over. Mabe he liked him... <|endoftext|>
If he hated him, he would have put him in to get hit over and over. Mabe he liked him... <|endoftext|> Perhaps, but to not play him at all the entire season seems a stretch. I mean in 2007, he threw a record 50 touchdown passes <|endoftext|>
Perhaps, but to not play him at all the entire season seems a stretch. I mean in 2007, he threw a record 50 touchdown passes <|endoftext|> Yeah. He's a really good QB. Probably the best ever. And he's married to a super model! <|endoftext|>
Yeah. He's a really good QB. Probably the best ever. And he's married to a super model! <|endoftext|> Doesn't she make 2x his salary? Power couple <|endoftext|>
Doesn't she make 2x his salary? Power couple <|endoftext|> yeah! I would love for my wife to make double what I make. I am not some macho guy, I am a capitalist above all! <|endoftext|>
yeah! I would love for my wife to make double what I make. I am not some macho guy, I am a capitalist above all! <|endoftext|> Speaking about Brady, I heard he never ate a strawberry. Seems a shame. I wonder if he doesn't eat it to say he never has <|endoftext|>
Speaking about Brady, I heard he never ate a strawberry. Seems a shame. I wonder if he doesn't eat it to say he never has <|endoftext|> He has some crazy diet. He likes avacado ice cream. Yuck! <|endoftext|>
He has some crazy diet. He likes avacado ice cream. Yuck! <|endoftext|> I actually have never tasted it so I can't really say. Sound healthy in a way tho <|endoftext|>
I actually have never tasted it so I can't really say. Sound healthy in a way tho <|endoftext|> it is healthy but when I eat ice cream, I want chocolate and peanut butter and a lot of it. Not avacados... <|endoftext|>
it is healthy but when I eat ice cream, I want chocolate and peanut butter and a lot of it. Not avacados... <|endoftext|> Personally Green tea is my favorite. By the way, do you like any other QB? <|endoftext|>

Really? How so? Personally I respect green ellis since he has never fumbled the ball his entire career <|endoftext|> Yeah, he was a really good QB. Jay is married to Kristin Cavalari and she has a show on E which he makes appearances on. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, he was a really good QB. Jay is married to Kristin Cavalari and she has a show on E which he makes appearances on. <|endoftext|> Well thank you for that information. I had an enjoyable chat and I will go check out Jay Cutler after this chat. <|endoftext|>

Hello, no I am not. I do find it oddly satisfying that his wife makes more money than he does <|endoftext|> Interesting. I think he is a good quarterback. <|endoftext|>
Interesting. I think he is a good quarterback. <|endoftext|> lol. Is that why Belichick lists him on the injury list each week? <|endoftext|>
lol. Is that why Belichick lists him on the injury list each week? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think it is to trick the other team. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I think it is to trick the other team. <|endoftext|> That doesn't make any sense. It's hilarious that his high school coach wouldn't start him. <|endoftext|>
That doesn't make any sense. It's hilarious that his high school coach wouldn't start him. <|endoftext|> Yeah, that is weird, same with the strawberry. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is weird, same with the strawberry. <|endoftext|> Is that due to his weird diet, like the avocado ice cream? <|endoftext|>
Is that due to his weird diet, like the avocado ice cream? <|endoftext|> Yeah, who knows. It works so perhaps he doesn't change it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, who knows. It works so perhaps he doesn't change it. <|endoftext|> Now that Cleveland has OBJ, I bet Mayfield is thankful he didn't quit to become a pro gamer. <|endoftext|>

Yep you're right. I wonder why Trump is not in there unless Perhaps it is because we cannot estimate his wealth? On a different note though, why do you think the guest house is larger than the White House itself, that doesn't seem right <|endoftext|> It probably is because they have a lot of people when visiting heads of government come to negotiate.

Well, during the 2012 US elections International electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states. <|endoftext|> See that scares me because I don't know why they would be blocked from the poles.

Horror is also said to burn up to 180 calories when watching.. as well as making you enjoy abstract art after watching horror films. <|endoftext|> I didn't know horror can burn fat, is there a scientific proof to it? <|endoftext|>
I didn't know horror can burn fat, is there a scientific proof to it? <|endoftext|> It says its factual, yes! I bet it has to do with heart rate increase. Nowadays, I feel like children of all ages are able to watch and see things made for people of any age. Theres this new movie coming out, The house with a clock in its walls. its actually a "tween" horror movie. I think its a good introduction to show to kids so they can get their curiosity out without having them see something they shouldnt. Do you have any children that watch movies of that nature? <|endoftext|>

Wow we learn everyday, I have learnt something new today. No but even if I have kids I don't think I'd let them watch a horror movie <|endoftext|> True, but i think i would allow the "tween" films if they REALLY wanted it, just so i could at least know what they were watching and that it was appropriate. speaking of tween watching, they also are making documentaries focused on that age as well. America to me, is one, that deals with race in schools. I think its a great idea. What do you think? <|endoftext|>

They used a razorblade and a pencil as the diode. Pretty inventive. <|endoftext|> That is very inventive and rather genius actually. I guess any kind of entertainment was cherished. <|endoftext|>
That is very inventive and rather genius actually. I guess any kind of entertainment was cherished. <|endoftext|> It was probably also a good way for them to get their news. <|endoftext|>
It was probably also a good way for them to get their news. <|endoftext|> That too for sure, on a different subject, do you watch fox news at all? <|endoftext|>
That too for sure, on a different subject, do you watch fox news at all? <|endoftext|> I do not. I tend to find them a bit slanted in their views. <|endoftext|>
I do not. I tend to find them a bit slanted in their views. <|endoftext|> I couldn't agree more, I didn't know how much more popular than the other networks they were though. <|endoftext|>
I couldn't agree more, I didn't know how much more popular than the other networks they were though. <|endoftext|> It is kind of shocking. I think it is funny they threatened to sue the simpsons for how the parody them <|endoftext|>
It is kind of shocking. I think it is funny they threatened to sue the simpsons for how the parody them <|endoftext|> That is too funny, and the fact that at one point they were considering starting an all simpsons channel! <|endoftext|>
That is too funny, and the fact that at one point they were considering starting an all simpsons channel! <|endoftext|> I could get behind that, but likely only for a few days. <|endoftext|>
I could get behind that, but likely only for a few days. <|endoftext|> I could, but only if they promised to only air the first 12 seasons or so, after that, no thank you. <|endoftext|>
I could, but only if they promised to only air the first 12 seasons or so, after that, no thank you. <|endoftext|> I havent watched much of the recent stuff as I cut my cable almost 3 years ago. <|endoftext|>

I did not know that Fox News was so popular, more than CNN and MSNBC combined. <|endoftext|> Me too, I also did not know that Fox news threatened to sue The Simpsons. Even though it's a comedy cartoon, they took it seriously. <|endoftext|>
Me too, I also did not know that Fox news threatened to sue The Simpsons. Even though it's a comedy cartoon, they took it seriously. <|endoftext|> Maybe they are more focused on a republican agenda than giving news. It was created by a republican strategist. <|endoftext|>
Maybe they are more focused on a republican agenda than giving news. It was created by a republican strategist. <|endoftext|> That does not surprise me. Both sides are guilty of pushing their own agendas but it seems like the right-wing have been becoming more violent. There has been an uprise in antisemitism among the right-wing. <|endoftext|>
That does not surprise me. Both sides are guilty of pushing their own agendas but it seems like the right-wing have been becoming more violent. There has been an uprise in antisemitism among the right-wing. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I did not know that those groups were targeting campuses to recruit. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I did not know that those groups were targeting campuses to recruit. <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's really bad because they are still young and impressionable. It seems like right-wing nationalism doesn't make sense since almost all Americans are foreigners. Some government officials perpetuate nationalism. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's really bad because they are still young and impressionable. It seems like right-wing nationalism doesn't make sense since almost all Americans are foreigners. Some government officials perpetuate nationalism. <|endoftext|> I don't think making sense is important for those group, they are blaming Georges Soros for funding the immigrant caravan. It does not make any sense but it fits their agenda. <|endoftext|>
I don't think making sense is important for those group, they are blaming Georges Soros for funding the immigrant caravan. It does not make any sense but it fits their agenda. <|endoftext|> That's true. They want to amplify right-wing nationalism and antisemitism but they want to be blameless if people become violent as a result of their agenda. <|endoftext|>
That's true. They want to amplify right-wing nationalism and antisemitism but they want to be blameless if people become violent as a result of their agenda. <|endoftext|> That's their paradox, they promote violences and hatred, yet they don't want to be blamed, like want happened in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|>
That's their paradox, they promote violences and hatred, yet they don't want to be blamed, like want happened in Pittsburgh. <|endoftext|> Yeah, it seems like more people are becoming more radical. It's not rare to find a radical left-wing or radical right-wing on campuses as well. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it seems like more people are becoming more radical. It's not rare to find a radical left-wing or radical right-wing on campuses as well. <|endoftext|> And their rhetoric is more violent, the guy who the the Pittsburgh shooting did not become anti-semitic by himself. He was reading and listening to this stuff. <|endoftext|>
And their rhetoric is more violent, the guy who the the Pittsburgh shooting did not become anti-semitic by himself. He was reading and listening to this stuff. <|endoftext|> True. Social media and certain news are responsible because they don't address complaints or disable accounts that engage in fear-mongering. <|endoftext|>
True. Social media and certain news are responsible because they don't address complaints or disable accounts that engage in fear-mongering. <|endoftext|> There is that, but also, the president should take the leadership for those issues. Being the head of the state, those kind of problems should be his priority. <|endoftext|>
There is that, but also, the president should take the leadership for those issues. Being the head of the state, those kind of problems should be his priority. <|endoftext|> Yes, the president has the authority to speak about these issues since the president is seen as the head of the government. <|endoftext|>
Yes, the president has the authority to speak about these issues since the president is seen as the head of the government. <|endoftext|> It in the case of the US, the role of the president is not ceremonial, it is even more important. <|endoftext|>
It in the case of the US, the role of the president is not ceremonial, it is even more important. <|endoftext|> The president's role is important even though sometimes people don't take the president seriously. Did you know the president of Zimbabwe was called president banana? <|endoftext|>
The president's role is important even though sometimes people don't take the president seriously. Did you know the president of Zimbabwe was called president banana? <|endoftext|> I think it was just the first president who was called like that. I don't think it caught on, even less after the introduction of the term "banana republic" which is derogatory. <|endoftext|>
I think it was just the first president who was called like that. I don't think it caught on, even less after the introduction of the term "banana republic" which is derogatory. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, it was just the first one.

Oh yeah, it was just the first one. I also didn't know that the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office. Imagine if the president did that here? <|endoftext|> It would give him another source of revenue, so he could be the wealthiest president in history, beating JFK would please him I am sure. <|endoftext|>
It would give him another source of revenue, so he could be the wealthiest president in history, beating JFK would please him I am sure. <|endoftext|> Yeah, and I'm sure the radio would play his music here and in Canada as well, despite their law in Canada about the radio playing Canadian music <|endoftext|>
Yeah, and I'm sure the radio would play his music here and in Canada as well, despite their law in Canada about the radio playing Canadian music <|endoftext|> It would go in the 60% of foreign music. Thanks for the conversation. <|endoftext|>

How do you feel about companies making comments on political issues? I don't like it too much but I guess it's okay if they are paying respect to some significant event. <|endoftext|> I think as long as they can be respectful or if it is a significant event it is fine. But it is slippery slope. The may lose support over it. <|endoftext|>
I think as long as they can be respectful or if it is a significant event it is fine. But it is slippery slope. The may lose support over it. <|endoftext|> I am on social media but not on Twitter, too much. I really get tired of hearing the President and other 'leaders' taking shots at each other on Twitter.

For real. It is like school yard gossip. Lets act like the adults we are. <|endoftext|> Maybe the way they did things in 1805 were better. If the first runner up gets to be VP, then maybe we would have a better spread of ideas and maybe a little more compromise. Things might get done! <|endoftext|>

Can you imagine the freakshow Trump and Hillary would be together in the whitehosue? <|endoftext|> HaHaHa! That's a good point! Speaking of a show, it's fun that the President of Indonesia has released three pop albums, while he was President! <|endoftext|>
HaHaHa! That's a good point! Speaking of a show, it's fun that the President of Indonesia has released three pop albums, while he was President! <|endoftext|> That is neat, it would be like Trump doing more Celebrity Apprentice. <|endoftext|>
That is neat, it would be like Trump doing more Celebrity Apprentice. <|endoftext|> True, but during office! With all his endeavors, I would think he would have been the wealthiest President, but JFK, Washington and Jefferson are the top three. I"m sure that is figuring in inflation etc. <|endoftext|>
True, but during office! With all his endeavors, I would think he would have been the wealthiest President, but JFK, Washington and Jefferson are the top three. I"m sure that is figuring in inflation etc. <|endoftext|> I agree. That is odd. <|endoftext|>

It's funny that the Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat at the same restaurant as any NFL player and even have to leave <|endoftext|> You know I've heard about that and I have to agree.

That's good. I do think it was sensationalized. Are you happy Foles is out? You're stuck with Wentz! <|endoftext|> I can think of worse quarterbacks to be stuck with.

If you can keep your health, sure. I think that no matter how good the helmet is, the brain is going to get banged around a lot. <|endoftext|> I wonder if it helps now that they keep chips in the shoulder pads and footballs. Or if that just helps more with the stats than anything else <|endoftext|>

Yeah, and he didn't want the other team to be able to read his signs. <|endoftext|> I wonder how long it took to teach the other players sign language. Isn't it crazy how there is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL. You'd think that there would be more. <|endoftext|>
I wonder how long it took to teach the other players sign language. Isn't it crazy how there is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL. You'd think that there would be more. <|endoftext|> Right.

Right. I wonder why that is. Another crazy thing is Tom Brady was a backup quarter back and his coach refused to start him even though they were losing. <|endoftext|> I bet he regrets that choice now.

Its interesting how many other people can affects a players ratings <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's hard for me to understand when they analyze plays and future scenarios in such technical ways but apparently they expect that he will catch less deep touchdown passes in the future. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's hard for me to understand when they analyze plays and future scenarios in such technical ways but apparently they expect that he will catch less deep touchdown passes in the future. <|endoftext|> Apparently its a hard thing to repeat.

None in particular.. more familiar with certain players than I am teams. For instance, I admire how former patriot qb Benjarvus has NEVER fumbled the ball in his entire NFL career.

That is just crazy for a back to never fumble once! That takes an incredible amount of skill and concentration. <|endoftext|> Pity Cumberland didn't have him on their team when they played Georgia TEch back in 1916. They lost that game 222 to ZERO. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-TWO. Either GT was REALLY good or someone just wasn't trying that day! <|endoftext|>

I think that is hilarious! But, it just goes to show just how much football has grown since then. <|endoftext|> So, how about movies? You watch a lot of movies? I do when I get a chance. Mainly horror and comedy, but I do catch dramas on occasion. <|endoftext|>

I think that is awesome, funny what a simple move years earlier will do down the road. <|endoftext|> Speaking of celebs, wonder what's up with Jim Carrey.

I'm not surprised. I do sometimes follow the American version. You? <|endoftext|> Nice. Yes I do as well, I think it is entertaining.

Nice. Yes I do as well, I think it is entertaining. I have also watched Aussie rules once but it is too confusing for me. Hard to believe that professional bowlers used to make more than football stars back in the 60's. <|endoftext|> Bowlers probably enjoyed a lot of interest because people participated in local leagues.

Bowlers probably enjoyed a lot of interest because people participated in local leagues. Plus college ball was popular. The pros hadn't gotten organized yet. <|endoftext|> That's true good point.

They get a lot of public attention. maybe too much. <|endoftext|>
Yeah maybe so. most NFL players are regarded as celebrities these days. They get a lot of public attention. maybe too much. <|endoftext|> I think there's to much emphasis on money.

I think there's to much emphasis on money. I'm not sure how much attention they would get without it? College ball now is important because of the pro game. Money distorts everything. <|endoftext|> Yeah very true. And all the college players are complaining because they don't make a salary. Well just look at tv actors.

no way, I didn't realize that. I just also have a huge issue with how scummy the NFL is to it's players and how much they extort their fans and tax payers. <|endoftext|> That is true.

Well I guess if they wanted to make thing interesting they can do like indonesias president and release 3 pop albums while in office. <|endoftext|> I heard about that, Trump should get working if he want to release a pop album before his time in office is over <|endoftext|>
I heard about that, Trump should get working if he want to release a pop album before his time in office is over <|endoftext|> You know it probably wouldnt be very surprising if he came out with an album while in office haha. <|endoftext|>
You know it probably wouldnt be very surprising if he came out with an album while in office haha. <|endoftext|> He should, I hear him and Kanye are really close so that could be a real thing, I would buy that album <|endoftext|>

I bet it is, so do you like to watch TV? <|endoftext|> I do. I find the Simpsons to be a funny show to help unwind. hard to believe after all those episode Bart is only excluded from one. <|endoftext|>
I do. I find the Simpsons to be a funny show to help unwind. hard to believe after all those episode Bart is only excluded from one. <|endoftext|> Thats hard to believe yeah, the show has been on many years and then Bart is only excluded in one episode, I sure wonder why. <|endoftext|>

Awesome. The first google computer at Stanford was housed in custom made enclosures constructed from legos. <|endoftext|> That's nice, my grandson loves legos. Getting back to the Gaza situation. You know that must be an awful way to have to life your everyday life. <|endoftext|>
That's nice, my grandson loves legos. Getting back to the Gaza situation. You know that must be an awful way to have to life your everyday life. <|endoftext|> I'm not sure, it doesn't sound fun. I've never been there. No desire to visit. I hear a lot about it on the radio. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure, it doesn't sound fun. I've never been there. No desire to visit. I hear a lot about it on the radio. <|endoftext|> Me either. Speaking of radio, did you know that by Canadian law all radios must play at least 40% Canadian music. Isn't that wild? <|endoftext|>
Me either. Speaking of radio, did you know that by Canadian law all radios must play at least 40% Canadian music. Isn't that wild? <|endoftext|> No, how bizarre? I don't even know any canadian musicians. <|endoftext|>

Celine Dion, is the only one I can think of. <|endoftext|> Ah, yeah. How could I forget her. I've only been to Canada twice, have you been? <|endoftext|>
Ah, yeah. How could I forget her. I've only been to Canada twice, have you been? <|endoftext|> Yes, a couple just mainly to see Niagra Falls, though.But, I didn't listen to the radio so I can't tell you if the 40% rule was being adhered to or not. Lol <|endoftext|>
Yes, a couple just mainly to see Niagra Falls, though.But, I didn't listen to the radio so I can't tell you if the 40% rule was being adhered to or not. Lol <|endoftext|> I've been to Niagra falls. Apparently there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sounds. <|endoftext|>
I've been to Niagra falls. Apparently there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sounds. <|endoftext|> That's cool. I heard that Jupiterhas radio storms that are so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio. <|endoftext|>

hi, do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|> Well, I think i am learning more everyday. I respect the office of the presidency. I visited to White House an noticed how much larger the guest house seemed to be. I was looking from far away though. <|endoftext|>
Well, I think i am learning more everyday. I respect the office of the presidency. I visited to White House an noticed how much larger the guest house seemed to be. I was looking from far away though. <|endoftext|> yeah that is strange, maybe they just get a lot of guests <|endoftext|>
yeah that is strange, maybe they just get a lot of guests <|endoftext|> Hmmm, that is an observation for sure. I am fascinated by the wealthy presidents which were JFK, Washington and Jefferson. Do you know anything about the presidency? <|endoftext|>

I know the president of indonesia is a pop artist <|endoftext|> Oh really? How stange for sure. The first president of zimbabwe had the nickname Banana. What a hoot. I don't know how to take a president serious with a nickname like Banana. It reminds me of a kids song. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? How stange for sure. The first president of zimbabwe had the nickname Banana. What a hoot. I don't know how to take a president serious with a nickname like Banana. It reminds me of a kids song. <|endoftext|> Yeah they guy went on to release three albums <|endoftext|>
Yeah they guy went on to release three albums <|endoftext|> Release albums? Weird. The U.S used to have some interesting procedures for electing the president. The runner up was automatically the vice pres. until 1805 when it changed and became the way it is today. <|endoftext|>
Release albums? Weird. The U.S used to have some interesting procedures for electing the president. The runner up was automatically the vice pres. until 1805 when it changed and became the way it is today. <|endoftext|> Yeah glad it changed otherwise I could not see Trump and Clinton working with each other <|endoftext|>
Yeah glad it changed otherwise I could not see Trump and Clinton working with each other <|endoftext|> No, that would not be a good match, infact. I totally agree with you on that. <|endoftext|>
No, that would not be a good match, infact. I totally agree with you on that. <|endoftext|> do you use your computer much? <|endoftext|>
do you use your computer much? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I use it all the time. I use programs all the time too. I use my microwave everyday and that is because a computer controls it. Computers are every I look in my house. Robots and computers-aided designs are in most every electronic now. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I use it all the time. I use programs all the time too. I use my microwave everyday and that is because a computer controls it. Computers are every I look in my house.

that is very true. did you know apple voidds the warranty if you smoke near their computers <|endoftext|> I have never heard of that, hmmm? That must be in the small print. It must be because smoking is a biohazard of sorts. <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that, hmmm? That must be in the small print. It must be because smoking is a biohazard of sorts. <|endoftext|> yeah I think that is the reason too but I had not heard of it before either <|endoftext|>
yeah I think that is the reason too but I had not heard of it before either <|endoftext|> Pretty interesting for sure. I learned that someone built a working computer from 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks, truly amazing. A long time ago in 1936 the russians also built a computer that ran on water. The race to build computers was on. <|endoftext|>

that is amazing wonder how many listeners they have. nice chat <|endoftext|> Do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>
Do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|> I enjoy the radio from time to time, but mostly listen to Apple Music. Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up by am radio! <|endoftext|>
I enjoy the radio from time to time, but mostly listen to Apple Music. Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up by am radio! <|endoftext|> Wow! I wonder what that sounds like? Do you think that they're storms like they kind we experience on earth? <|endoftext|>
Wow! I wonder what that sounds like? Do you think that they're storms like they kind we experience on earth? <|endoftext|> That's a good question I guess they would sound like static. Radio carries sound using electromagnetic energy so I think it interferes with that. <|endoftext|>
That's a good question I guess they would sound like static. Radio carries sound using electromagnetic energy so I think it interferes with that. <|endoftext|> Radios are supposed to be somewhat simple machines, they say that soldiers in WWII made them out of razorblades and pencils but I find that so hard to imagine! <|endoftext|>
Radios are supposed to be somewhat simple machines, they say that soldiers in WWII made them out of razorblades and pencils but I find that so hard to imagine! <|endoftext|> Oh yeah the foxhole radios? I need to look that up on my computer! Speaking of computers did you know that smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty as it makes it a biohazard? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah the foxhole radios? I need to look that up on my computer! Speaking of computers did you know that smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty as it makes it a biohazard? <|endoftext|> That's so weird! You'd think smoke of some kind was used to make the computer to begin with. I guess those people are all covered up though, right? I wonder if there are other things on their biohazard list <|endoftext|>
That's so weird! You'd think smoke of some kind was used to make the computer to begin with. I guess those people are all covered up though, right? I wonder if there are other things on their biohazard list <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to know that as well. You ever heard of transhumanists? It is a group of people who want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! <|endoftext|>
Yes I would like to know that as well. You ever heard of transhumanists? It is a group of people who want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! <|endoftext|> I didn't know there was a name for a person like that. All that type of stuff seems so Twilight Zone it's hard to imagine that it could be real. What do you think they hope to accomplish by that? <|endoftext|>
I didn't know there was a name for a person like that. All that type of stuff seems so Twilight Zone it's hard to imagine that it could be real. What do you think they hope to accomplish by that? <|endoftext|> Yes I think it's very odd too. They probably want to live on forever. Maybe the Russians will find a way. They found a way to build a computer that ran on water! <|endoftext|>
Yes I think it's very odd too. They probably want to live on forever. Maybe the Russians will find a way. They found a way to build a computer that ran on water! <|endoftext|> That seems counter intuitive doesn't it? Although maybe "running on water" means like water power like dams and the like? <|endoftext|>
That seems counter intuitive doesn't it? Although maybe "running on water" means like water power like dams and the like? <|endoftext|> Yes that's a good theory. I think you could be right. I didn't know that simple devices like microwave ovens and remote controls were considered computer devices! <|endoftext|>
Yes that's a good theory. I think you could be right. I didn't know that simple devices like microwave ovens and remote controls were considered computer devices! <|endoftext|> I've never really thought about it before but I guess that makes sense because you input commands into a microwave and it does what you ask, right? <|endoftext|>
I've never really thought about it before but I guess that makes sense because you input commands into a microwave and it does what you ask, right? <|endoftext|> True yes. Someone even built a working computer using the basic minecraft building blocks. It was only a 16-bit computer though but still! <|endoftext|>
True yes. Someone even built a working computer using the basic minecraft building blocks. It was only a 16-bit computer though but still! <|endoftext|> I can't imagine ever doing that, could you? These people who are building radios and computers from stuff just lying around truly amaze me <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine ever doing that, could you? These people who are building radios and computers from stuff just lying around truly amaze me <|endoftext|> No I could never! Yes they are so smart with tech! The space shuttles general purpose computer only runs on 1mb of Ram! <|endoftext|>
No I could never! Yes they are so smart with tech! The space shuttles general purpose computer only runs on 1mb of Ram! <|endoftext|> How is that even possible? That seems like so little! I wonder if there are so many computers involved on board and at ground control that they don't need to be that powerful <|endoftext|>
How is that even possible? That seems like so little! I wonder if there are so many computers involved on board and at ground control that they don't need to be that powerful <|endoftext|> Yeah I don't understand it all in its entirety to be honest! Just as long as the president knows what's going on! The top 3 wealthiest presidents have been JFK, Washington, and Jefferson! <|endoftext|>
Yeah I don't understand it all in its entirety to be honest! Just as long as the president knows what's going on! The top 3 wealthiest presidents have been JFK, Washington, and Jefferson! <|endoftext|> Oh really? I wonder how Trump compares to them now? <|endoftext|>
Oh really? I wonder how Trump compares to them now? <|endoftext|> I would guess he would be number one. I wonder if the president of Indonesia cashed out with his pop albums? Well it was nice talking with you! <|endoftext|>

Thanks for you, how much do you know about computers <|endoftext|> I suppose that I know more than the average individual, but I wouldn't consider myself to be an expert by any means. I know that if you smoke around Apple computers, it voids their warranty <|endoftext|>

It blows my mind that our modern computers contain 200+mb of RAM while the space shuttle's computer only runs on 1mb <|endoftext|> if so it must be that according to their functions, some computers work better with a certain amount of RAM but others do not <|endoftext|>
if so it must be that according to their functions, some computers work better with a certain amount of RAM but others do not <|endoftext|> That may be so. Otherwise the computer must be aided by a plethora of other systems, e.g. industrial robots and other computers. If the Russians can make computers that run on water, I'm sure that we can accomplish quite a bit in life. <|endoftext|>
That may be so. Otherwise the computer must be aided by a plethora of other systems, e.g. industrial robots and other computers.

Sure, what if we talk about the radio. Did you know that radio waves can be used to transport information <|endoftext|> Yes, I know that by changing features such as wavelength, amplitude, etc, we can vary the energy of the waves and, subsequently, the information conveyed by them <|endoftext|>

If so, incredible. Now let's talk about politics tell me what party do you support <|endoftext|> I don't really support any of the most popular parties.

Yes. Its amazing what some people can come up with. <|endoftext|> I for one am not that smart but for some to build a working computer that runs on water or like another that built a 16-bit computer using the basic building blocks from the minecraft building game is amazing to me. <|endoftext|>
I for one am not that smart but for some to build a working computer that runs on water or like another that built a 16-bit computer using the basic building blocks from the minecraft building game is amazing to me. <|endoftext|> Its really something that they could build a computer from minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|>
Its really something that they could build a computer from minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|> Do you know that computers by the apple corporation can be labeled as biohazard an d the warrenty becomes void if they are smoked around? <|endoftext|>
Do you know that computers by the apple corporation can be labeled as biohazard an d the warrenty becomes void if they are smoked around? <|endoftext|> Yes. I had read that somewhere. <|endoftext|>
Yes. I had read that somewhere. <|endoftext|> I have also heard that some transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers as well as to memory sticks; I mean how is that even possible or done for that matter? <|endoftext|>
I have also heard that some transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers as well as to memory sticks; I mean how is that even possible or done for that matter? <|endoftext|> I would pay to see that. <|endoftext|>
I would pay to see that. <|endoftext|> You and I both; HA HA! I was reading a factoid book the other day of weird and interesting facts and do you know that the first president in Zimbabwe was called President Banana? <|endoftext|>
You and I both; HA HA! I was reading a factoid book the other day of weird and interesting facts and do you know that the first president in Zimbabwe was called President Banana? <|endoftext|> No I didnt that is pretty funny. <|endoftext|>
No I didnt that is pretty funny. <|endoftext|> I just wonder who and how these things are come up with? For example; the president of Indonesia released three pop albums while in office, do they have that much free time as president to entertain the possibility of singing? <|endoftext|>
I just wonder who and how these things are come up with? For example; the president of Indonesia released three pop albums while in office, do they have that much free time as president to entertain the possibility of singing? <|endoftext|> I have read that before. Maybe he was in show business before he was elected. <|endoftext|>
I have read that before. Maybe he was in show business before he was elected. <|endoftext|> I would think that is a possibility as well. Do you know the three most richest US presidents were that of JFK, Jefferson and Washington? <|endoftext|>
I would think that is a possibility as well. Do you know the three most richest US presidents were that of JFK, Jefferson and Washington? <|endoftext|> Yes. I read once that Jefferson was very wealthy. <|endoftext|>
Yes. I read once that Jefferson was very wealthy. <|endoftext|> I by no means want to be president I just want enough money that my bills are paid and I have enough left over to eat until the next payday. I do find it interesting though that the guest house to the White House is larger that the White House it's self. <|endoftext|>
I by no means want to be president I just want enough money that my bills are paid and I have enough left over to eat until the next payday. I do find it interesting though that the guest house to the White House is larger that the White House it's self. <|endoftext|> That is a surprise <|endoftext|>
That is a surprise <|endoftext|> Do you listen much to the radio? I do at times and find it interesting to know that in WW2 a radio was made by some soldiers from a razor blade and a pencil calling them foxhold radio's. <|endoftext|>
Do you listen much to the radio? I do at times and find it interesting to know that in WW2 a radio was made by some soldiers from a razor blade and a pencil calling them foxhold radio's. <|endoftext|> I have read that before. I keep meaning to look up on the internet how to do that. <|endoftext|>
I have read that before. I keep meaning to look up on the internet how to do that. <|endoftext|> I just find it interesting at some of things people come up with of the simplest things and make something functional as a result. <|endoftext|>
I just find it interesting at some of things people come up with of the simplest things and make something functional as a result. <|endoftext|> I guess when people have a need for something, they can get it done in most cases. <|endoftext|>
I guess when people have a need for something, they can get it done in most cases. <|endoftext|> The mother of inventing is that of a need I was always reminded from my grandmother! Did you know that Jupiter has storms so strong that they can be picked up on an AM radio? <|endoftext|>
The mother of inventing is that of a need I was always reminded from my grandmother! Did you know that Jupiter has storms so strong that they can be picked up on an AM radio? <|endoftext|> I did read that somewhere. I would like to listen to one of those storms on the radio. <|endoftext|>
I did read that somewhere. I would like to listen to one of those storms on the radio. <|endoftext|> I think it would be really cool to listen to as well. I mean compared to storm I have here as my own house at times would there be anything similar you think? <|endoftext|>
I think it would be really cool to listen to as well. I mean compared to storm I have here as my own house at times would there be anything similar you think? <|endoftext|> I do not think we have anything similar on earth. <|endoftext|>
I do not think we have anything similar on earth. <|endoftext|> Just simple things I seem to wonder about at times I suppose, I mean is a storm here by any means the same as another planet? in a sense I would think yes but on the other hand maybe no? The basic foundation would be the same but maybe it is the level of actual waves of electricity would differ? <|endoftext|>
Just simple things I seem to wonder about at times I suppose, I mean is a storm here by any means the same as another planet? in a sense I would think yes but on the other hand maybe no? The basic foundation would be the same but maybe it is the level of actual waves of electricity would differ? <|endoftext|> I think the difference in the atmosphere would make the storms very different. <|endoftext|>
I think the difference in the atmosphere would make the storms very different. <|endoftext|> You are probably correct on that! I am going to have to investigate that further this afternoon I think and see if I can find that radio station and see if I can find the sounds of a storm on Jupiter and see how it compares to a storm here on earth. <|endoftext|>
You are probably correct on that! I am going to have to investigate that further this afternoon I think and see if I can find that radio station and see if I can find the sounds of a storm on Jupiter and see how it compares to a storm here on earth. <|endoftext|> Well its been nice talking to you. Have a nice day. <|endoftext|>
Well its been nice talking to you. Have a nice day. <|endoftext|> I agree; I hope you have a fantastic day as well. <|endoftext|>
I agree; I hope you have a fantastic day as well. <|endoftext|> I am having trouble twith the done button on my side. there may be a glitch. <|endoftext|>
I am having trouble twith the done button on my side. there may be a glitch. <|endoftext|> Good Morning. <|endoftext|>
Good Morning. <|endoftext|> Good morning. How are you? I am hanging out on my computer this morning. <|endoftext|>
Good morning. How are you? I am hanging out on my computer this morning. <|endoftext|> Really, thats cool. Did you know that somebody built a 16 bit computer out of basic minecraft building blocks and the thing actually worked? <|endoftext|>
Really, thats cool. Did you know that somebody built a 16 bit computer out of basic minecraft building blocks and the thing actually worked? <|endoftext|> No, but that is impressive! Back in 1936 a computer that ran on water was built by the Russians. Sounds like they were ahead of their time! <|endoftext|>
No, but that is impressive! Back in 1936 a computer that ran on water was built by the Russians. Sounds like they were ahead of their time! <|endoftext|> I read about that awhile back. It was made to calculate pouring concrete if I remember correctly. <|endoftext|>
I read about that awhile back. It was made to calculate pouring concrete if I remember correctly. <|endoftext|> Oh, I was unaware. Do you know about Apple's computer warranty restrictions? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I was unaware. Do you know about Apple's computer warranty restrictions? <|endoftext|> I heard about it. I don't think that's right. I don't see how they would even know in the first place though. <|endoftext|>
I heard about it. I don't think that's right. I don't see how they would even know in the first place though. <|endoftext|> I would think the tar from smoking around the compute would collect on the inner parts just like it does inside of a smoker's house. <|endoftext|>
I would think the tar from smoking around the compute would collect on the inner parts just like it does inside of a smoker's house. <|endoftext|> I dont know you may be right. Have you heard about transhuminists. People who want to put their minds into computers. <|endoftext|>
I dont know you may be right. Have you heard about transhuminists. People who want to put their minds into computers. <|endoftext|> That is insane! How do they think their minds can be uploaded to a memory stick? <|endoftext|>
That is insane! How do they think their minds can be uploaded to a memory stick? <|endoftext|> I have no idea. I would say the electrical impulses in the brain somehow control the computer. Not sure though. Im no transhuminist. Lol. <|endoftext|>
I have no idea. I would say the electrical impulses in the brain somehow control the computer. Not sure though. Im no transhuminist. Lol. <|endoftext|> No I'm not either, so no idea. I thought the space shuttle computer was heftier than it is, but it only runs on 1 mb of ram. <|endoftext|>
No I'm not either, so no idea. I thought the space shuttle computer was heftier than it is, but it only runs on 1 mb of ram. <|endoftext|> That is amazing. On another topic. Did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. On another topic. Did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house? <|endoftext|> No, I did not. Maybe it's that way so no guests can stay in the White House. <|endoftext|>
No, I did not. Maybe it's that way so no guests can stay in the White House. <|endoftext|> Maybe that is why. I heard that the president of indonesia has released pop albums. You would think he would be to busy for stuff like that. <|endoftext|>
Maybe that is why. I heard that the president of indonesia has released pop albums. You would think he would be to busy for stuff like that. <|endoftext|> I know our President is too busy for that. On a funny note, President Banana was the name given to Zimbabwe's first President. <|endoftext|>
I know our President is too busy for that. On a funny note, President Banana was the name given to Zimbabwe's first President. <|endoftext|> I wonder if he was born with that name or if he was actually given the name later? <|endoftext|>
I wonder if he was born with that name or if he was actually given the name later? <|endoftext|> It sounds like it was a given name. I'm glad that in the US the Presidential election runner up no longer automatically becomes the VP. I wonder what things were like before 1805 when the rule changed. <|endoftext|>
It sounds like it was a given name. I'm glad that in the US the Presidential election runner up no longer automatically becomes the VP. I wonder what things were like before 1805 when the rule changed. <|endoftext|> I think in those days it was more about geting the country up and running. Theuy were more worried about the british in those days than each other. All americans had a special bond bac then, because they all fought together for independence. <|endoftext|>
I think in those days it was more about geting the country up and running. Theuy were more worried about the british in those days than each other. All americans had a special bond bac then, because they all fought together for independence. <|endoftext|> That makes sense. They knew how to get a long even across party lines. <|endoftext|>
That makes sense. They knew how to get a long even across party lines. <|endoftext|> I would say that those guys would be ashamed to see how things are today in the elections. I better be getting off here though. Have a good one. <|endoftext|>
I would say that those guys would be ashamed to see how things are today in the elections. I better be getting off here though. Have a good one. <|endoftext|> It was nice chatting. You have a good day as well. <|endoftext|>
It was nice chatting. You have a good day as well. <|endoftext|> Do you use computers a lot? <|endoftext|>
Do you use computers a lot? <|endoftext|> I do, all of the time. It's hard to believe someone created a computer that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via programming. <|endoftext|>
I do, all of the time. It's hard to believe someone created a computer that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via programming. <|endoftext|> That is crazy right, well the Russians did make a computer that ran on water back in the year 1936 <|endoftext|>
That is crazy right, well the Russians did make a computer that ran on water back in the year 1936 <|endoftext|> That is pretty forward thinking for the time. I know smoking by an apple computer voids the warranty by making it a bio hazzard. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty forward thinking for the time. I know smoking by an apple computer voids the warranty by making it a bio hazzard. <|endoftext|> That a terrible way to lose a warranty, computers have advanced a lot over the years <|endoftext|>
That a terrible way to lose a warranty, computers have advanced a lot over the years <|endoftext|> They sure have. Someone has built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|>
They sure have. Someone has built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|> That is crazy, must require a lot of skill, building a computer out of minecraft blocks <|endoftext|>
That is crazy, must require a lot of skill, building a computer out of minecraft blocks <|endoftext|> I would say so. <|endoftext|>
I would say so. <|endoftext|> Do you know the space shuttle general purpose computer? <|endoftext|>
Do you know the space shuttle general purpose computer? <|endoftext|> I have heard about it. Is it the one that runs on 1mb of RAM? <|endoftext|>
I have heard about it. Is it the one that runs on 1mb of RAM? <|endoftext|> Yeah the same one, kind of scary, 1 mb is nothing now a days, <|endoftext|>
Yeah the same one, kind of scary, 1 mb is nothing now a days, <|endoftext|> It sure isn't. I find it odd that trans humanists want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks. <|endoftext|>
It sure isn't. I find it odd that trans humanists want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks. <|endoftext|> That is odd, I wonder if that will work, so many memories, humans are complex so a lot can be lost in the process <|endoftext|>
That is odd, I wonder if that will work, so many memories, humans are complex so a lot can be lost in the process <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree. It's crazy what people think. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree. It's crazy what people think. <|endoftext|> Do you also listen to the radio or not anymore? <|endoftext|>
Do you also listen to the radio or not anymore? <|endoftext|> I do. I really like the radio. Did you know Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up and heard by an am radio? <|endoftext|>
I do. I really like the radio. Did you know Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up and heard by an am radio? <|endoftext|> I didnt know that no, I did hear about the Canadian government and a law that they have concerning local music <|endoftext|>
I didnt know that no, I did hear about the Canadian government and a law that they have concerning local music <|endoftext|> I have heard they require at least 40% of the music played to be Canadian. <|endoftext|>
I have heard they require at least 40% of the music played to be Canadian. <|endoftext|> Yeah 40% of the music, I think its great that they support local talent <|endoftext|>
Yeah 40% of the music, I think its great that they support local talent <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. <|endoftext|> I would love to tune in that site, I love drama series. <|endoftext|>
I would love to tune in that site, I love drama series. <|endoftext|> I couldn't imagine living in such a volitile area as the gaza strip. <|endoftext|>
I couldn't imagine living in such a volitile area as the gaza strip. <|endoftext|> I know what you mean. It's dangerous with Hamas took it over 11 years ago. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. It's dangerous with Hamas took it over 11 years ago. <|endoftext|> It is so sad because the militaries are trying their best to kill each other and the innocents that live there are just stuck in the middle of this war. <|endoftext|>
It is so sad because the militaries are trying their best to kill each other and the innocents that live there are just stuck in the middle of this war. <|endoftext|> It is sad. I'm not sure if the land belongs to Israel or Palestine but I do know that there have been three ways with Hamas. <|endoftext|>
It is sad. I'm not sure if the land belongs to Israel or Palestine but I do know that there have been three ways with Hamas. <|endoftext|> It is terrible. In the recent attacked it wasn't just militants either. Over 80 of the people were women and children. <|endoftext|>
It is terrible. In the recent attacked it wasn't just militants either. Over 80 of the people were women and children. <|endoftext|> I get that there are emotions on both sides and have been that way for years but it does some that some of the people just make things worse. When you have crowds of angry people streaming towards a border someone is bound to get hurt. <|endoftext|>
I get that there are emotions on both sides and have been that way for years but it does some that some of the people just make things worse. When you have crowds of angry people streaming towards a border someone is bound to get hurt. <|endoftext|> For sure. Everytime I read something about it I wonder how the doctors in those areas feel. It is their job to heal and all they see over and over is this death and destruction. <|endoftext|>
For sure. Everytime I read something about it I wonder how the doctors in those areas feel. It is their job to heal and all they see over and over is this death and destruction. <|endoftext|> That's a good point. I'm sure it is very hard for them. There is definitely a lot of gun shot wounds and bombing injuries to deal with. I heard during the peak of one border crisis there was gunshot injury every few minutes. <|endoftext|>
That's a good point. I'm sure it is very hard for them. There is definitely a lot of gun shot wounds and bombing injuries to deal with. I heard during the peak of one border crisis there was gunshot injury every few minutes. <|endoftext|> That is terrible. You would think in this day and age with all our advancements and tech we would stop shooting each other. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. You would think in this day and age with all our advancements and tech we would stop shooting each other. <|endoftext|> i hear you there. If the russians can make a computer than can run on water then people can surely find other ways to iron out grievances. <|endoftext|>
i hear you there. If the russians can make a computer than can run on water then people can surely find other ways to iron out grievances. <|endoftext|> A computer that ran on water!? That is amazing! It is crazy how far computers have come in such a short amount of time. <|endoftext|>
A computer that ran on water!? That is amazing! It is crazy how far computers have come in such a short amount of time. <|endoftext|> I know. I mean, there's a guy or girl that built one out of minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|>
I know. I mean, there's a guy or girl that built one out of minecraft building blocks. <|endoftext|> That would be so cool to see. It is interesting to me how many things computer chips are in nowdays from tvs to something as simple as a remote. <|endoftext|>
That would be so cool to see. It is interesting to me how many things computer chips are in nowdays from tvs to something as simple as a remote. <|endoftext|> They are in everything aren't they? Who knew programs would be so important years ago. Back in the day people were happy to make a radio out of a pencil and a razor blade and now we have people trying to find ways to upload their minds to computers. <|endoftext|>
They are in everything aren't they? Who knew programs would be so important years ago. Back in the day people were happy to make a radio out of a pencil and a razor blade and now we have people trying to find ways to upload their minds to computers. <|endoftext|> I don't understand people sometimes. Of course it all comes down to hubris and not wanting to accept that death is a part of the human condition. <|endoftext|>
I don't understand people sometimes. Of course it all comes down to hubris and not wanting to accept that death is a part of the human condition. <|endoftext|> You'll have to explain to me what hubris is. I am not familiar with that term. <|endoftext|>
You'll have to explain to me what hubris is. I am not familiar with that term. <|endoftext|> Basically ego. So what makes a politician get up in the morning. <|endoftext|>
Basically ego. So what makes a politician get up in the morning. <|endoftext|> Oh I get it. It's like the president of indonesia not only being president but releasing 3 pop albums as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh I get it. It's like the president of indonesia not only being president but releasing 3 pop albums as well. <|endoftext|> Pretty much. Why music albums? Like is running a country not enough for you? Are things that great that it doesn't require your entire focus? <|endoftext|>
Pretty much. Why music albums? Like is running a country not enough for you? Are things that great that it doesn't require your entire focus? <|endoftext|> Exactly! Does he need that much attention all the time? In our country the guest house of the president is bigger than the president's house. Doesn't sound like too much ego there. <|endoftext|>
Exactly! Does he need that much attention all the time? In our country the guest house of the president is bigger than the president's house. Doesn't sound like too much ego there. <|endoftext|> We have some of the wealthiest presidents though. Look at JFK. <|endoftext|>
We have some of the wealthiest presidents though. Look at JFK. <|endoftext|> Hi, do you like basketball? <|endoftext|>

I'm great thank you. I love going to games myself. Did you know Jabbar's dunk was banned in college for 10 years? <|endoftext|> No, really! Was that the same as the granny dunk or something else? <|endoftext|>
No, really! Was that the same as the granny dunk or something else? <|endoftext|> I have no idea what style of dunk it was. In 39 of 50 states, the top paid state employee is either a college basketball or football coach. <|endoftext|>
I have no idea what style of dunk it was. In 39 of 50 states, the top paid state employee is either a college basketball or football coach. <|endoftext|> Yes, I heard that too! interesting. Did you know both basketball and volleyball were invented by the YMCA? Love them both! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I heard that too! interesting. Did you know both basketball and volleyball were invented by the YMCA? Love them both! <|endoftext|> Oh wow I didn't know that. I also love them both. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I didn't know that. I also love them both. <|endoftext|> I didn't know that Shaq only had one recorded 3pt score throughout his whole career? I remember him when he played for the Orlando Magic!! Use to go to those games too! <|endoftext|>
I didn't know that Shaq only had one recorded 3pt score throughout his whole career? I remember him when he played for the Orlando Magic!! Use to go to those games too! <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know that either. The New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the Tall Blacks. <|endoftext|>
Wow I didn't know that either. The New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the Tall Blacks. <|endoftext|> Really, I didn't know New Zealand had a basketball team? Not sure if that name is PC in the US? <|endoftext|>
Really, I didn't know New Zealand had a basketball team? Not sure if that name is PC in the US? <|endoftext|> I bet that name wouldn't fly here in the US. The Supreme Court has a basketball court on their top floor. <|endoftext|>
I bet that name wouldn't fly here in the US. The Supreme Court has a basketball court on their top floor. <|endoftext|> Yes, I heard that! Very cool. Great way to get exercise while at work!! I think it was called the highest court in the land! lol, Good one. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I heard that! Very cool. Great way to get exercise while at work!! I think it was called the highest court in the land! lol, Good one. <|endoftext|> Very clever name for the court. Did you know Reggie Miller had a sister who was better at basketball than he was? <|endoftext|>
Very clever name for the court. Did you know Reggie Miller had a sister who was better at basketball than he was? <|endoftext|> No really, was she tall? Talented family for sure!! <|endoftext|>
No really, was she tall? Talented family for sure!! <|endoftext|> Not too sure how tall she is. Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA, but Jordan still wore them and Nike paid his fines. <|endoftext|>
Not too sure how tall she is. Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA, but Jordan still wore them and Nike paid his fines. <|endoftext|> That's true, smart move!! Did you see Space Jam? <|endoftext|>
That's true, smart move!! Did you see Space Jam? <|endoftext|> I have seen it. I love that movie. What about you? <|endoftext|>
I have seen it. I love that movie. What about you? <|endoftext|> Yes, Great probably why it was the highest grossing basketball movie of all time! I'm surprised Woodrow Wilson was the only president with a PHD! <|endoftext|>
Yes, Great probably why it was the highest grossing basketball movie of all time! I'm surprised Woodrow Wilson was the only president with a PHD! <|endoftext|> For sure. I find that hard to believe he's the only one with a PHD! <|endoftext|>
For sure. I find that hard to believe he's the only one with a PHD! <|endoftext|> Yeah, right? Its too bad that Wilkes Booth had to be in the first photo taken at an inauguration with Lincoln! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, right? Its too bad that Wilkes Booth had to be in the first photo taken at an inauguration with Lincoln! <|endoftext|> For sure! Well, it was a pleasure talking to you. Have a good day. <|endoftext|>

Hello there, do you follow the NBA at all? <|endoftext|> I don't, I do not really car that mich for basketball. <|endoftext|>
I don't, I do not really car that mich for basketball. <|endoftext|> Ok, do you know who Allen Iverson is? <|endoftext|>
Ok, do you know who Allen Iverson is? <|endoftext|> Yes, hes a former basketball player, he stands to make a ton of money pretty much until he dies. <|endoftext|>
Yes, hes a former basketball player, he stands to make a ton of money pretty much until he dies. <|endoftext|> Yeah he sure does, do you think that Reebok, who owes him $32 million to him in a few years, wishes they could take that back? <|endoftext|>
Yeah he sure does, do you think that Reebok, who owes him $32 million to him in a few years, wishes they could take that back? <|endoftext|> I mean he is only 43, so they don't have to pay for another 12 years. I doubt they wish they could take it back because I am pretty sure they have more than enough money to pay it. <|endoftext|>
I mean he is only 43, so they don't have to pay for another 12 years. I doubt they wish they could take it back because I am pretty sure they have more than enough money to pay it. <|endoftext|> I don't know, I think they wish they could, I think that they thought they were signing a lifetime shoe seller like MJ. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, I think they wish they could, I think that they thought they were signing a lifetime shoe seller like MJ. <|endoftext|> MJ is beast of a different color than, I dont think any one will ever live up to that dude, and certainly not Allen Iverson, but in the grand scheme of things Reebok is with enough money that 32 million is pocket change really. <|endoftext|>
MJ is beast of a different color than, I dont think any one will ever live up to that dude, and certainly not Allen Iverson, but in the grand scheme of things Reebok is with enough money that 32 million is pocket change really. <|endoftext|> That part is true and yeah he sure is. Do you know what the nickname of the New Zealand national basketball teams name is? <|endoftext|>

They are Named the tall blacks which in hind site is a bit racist. <|endoftext|> Yeah it is, but I don't think they mean it to be, I think it is just the color of the jerseys they wear, I know the rugby team is nicknamed the 'all whites' or something like that. <|endoftext|>

Yes, JFK was one of the top three richest presidents. I heard that Washington and Jefferson were the other two. <|endoftext|> Nice! But if Presidents are so rich, why don't they stay in the guest house instead of the White House? After all, it is bigger! <|endoftext|>
Nice! But if Presidents are so rich, why don't they stay in the guest house instead of the White House? After all, it is bigger! <|endoftext|> Yeah, one would think!

Hello, did you know that JFK, Washington, and Jefferson where the three richest Presidents in history. <|endoftext|> That is surprising to me. When you're a president you get to live in luxury. But did you know the guest house is larger than the white house? <|endoftext|>
That is surprising to me. When you're a president you get to live in luxury. But did you know the guest house is larger than the white house? <|endoftext|> No, I didn't know that. I did know that the President Banana was what they called the first President of Zimbabwe. <|endoftext|>
No, I didn't know that. I did know that the President Banana was what they called the first President of Zimbabwe. <|endoftext|> I wonder why they would call him that. Apparently being president could be good for your music career. The president of Indonesia has released three pop albums while in office <|endoftext|>

Wow, that would be very interesting. People would be forced to get along somewhat. <|endoftext|> I think that could be very useful. That is how they did it until 1805. <|endoftext|>
I think that could be very useful. That is how they did it until 1805. <|endoftext|> Yes, then different parties would work together. Have you been to a presidential library? <|endoftext|>
Yes, then different parties would work together. Have you been to a presidential library? <|endoftext|> No I have not. Speaking of libraries and books, if you publish a book in Norway, they will buy 1000 copies and send them to libraries around the country. <|endoftext|>
No I have not. Speaking of libraries and books, if you publish a book in Norway, they will buy 1000 copies and send them to libraries around the country. <|endoftext|> That seems really helpful to new authors. <|endoftext|>

Yes, I think that is great. I think it is good that there are more libraries than Mcdonald's in the US. <|endoftext|> In Sacramento you can check out more than books, even sewing machines. <|endoftext|>
In Sacramento you can check out more than books, even sewing machines. <|endoftext|> Really, that is cool. Are you a Tv fan. I am a huge tv and movie buff. Did you know that there is only one episode that Bart Simpson did not appear in or is mentioned. <|endoftext|>
Really, that is cool. Are you a Tv fan. I am a huge tv and movie buff. Did you know that there is only one episode that Bart Simpson did not appear in or is mentioned. <|endoftext|> No, I had not heard that. I wonder why they decided to omit him. Are you into Pokemon? Apparently there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon! <|endoftext|>
No, I had not heard that. I wonder why they decided to omit him. Are you into Pokemon? Apparently there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon! <|endoftext|> My son loved Pokemon when he was young.

Sometimes when a show is good they try to remake it. They tried to redo that 70s show in the UK, verbatim, and it only lasted ten episodes <|endoftext|> Guess they like different things over there.

Guess they like different things over there. I heard the Simpsons crew send the producers of South Park flowers when they aired its Family Guy episode finale. <|endoftext|> I think it might have just been because the remake wasn't as good.

I think it might have just been because the remake wasn't as good.

Lol, I guess we're not the only ones in the world doing unique things. <|endoftext|> No, we just perfected it! <|endoftext|>
No, we just perfected it! <|endoftext|> Well, we're Americans, the world would expect nothing less.

I have never been and I feel like I missed out. I want to go see all of that stuff. I am into history so it would be important. <|endoftext|> Yes, you should do it. It used to be alot more accessible before 9/11, but it's important and I think everyone should check it out at least once. Williamsburg, too that was cool! <|endoftext|>
Yes, you should do it. It used to be alot more accessible before 9/11, but it's important and I think everyone should check it out at least once. Williamsburg, too that was cool! <|endoftext|> Williamsburg? PA? <|endoftext|>

I have no idea? Was JFK one. I know his dad was wealthy. <|endoftext|> Yes, he was along with Washington, and Jefferson. Somehow, I think Trump will eventually be added to that list, though. Isn't he like a billionaire? <|endoftext|>
Yes, he was along with Washington, and Jefferson. Somehow, I think Trump will eventually be added to that list, though. Isn't he like a billionaire? <|endoftext|> I am not sure.

How's it going, did you know the functions of the president is different for each state they are in? <|endoftext|> I did not know that. I would think that would be more the Governor's responsibility. I do like when the President has a pet, like a dog, who are actually not colorblind. <|endoftext|>
I did not know that. I would think that would be more the Governor's responsibility. I do like when the President has a pet, like a dog, who are actually not colorblind. <|endoftext|> Nice, I wonder if the first president of Zimbabwe had a dog or other pets <|endoftext|>

I wonder too. If he was the President of Istanbul he would have approved of vending machines that release food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. <|endoftext|> That's pretty cool Istanbul does that, I wonder if JFK, Washington, or Jefferson did nice things for dogs too since they were the 3 wealthiest US presidents <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool Istanbul does that, I wonder if JFK, Washington, or Jefferson did nice things for dogs too since they were the 3 wealthiest US presidents <|endoftext|> I wouldn't doubt it.

I have not heard of such a thing. But I do know that the dog would know what book you are pointing to. Only dogs and elephants instinctively understand pointing. <|endoftext|> That's pretty cool, I know there's some cool dog shows on tv and plus they are common in tv advertising too <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool, I know there's some cool dog shows on tv and plus they are common in tv advertising too <|endoftext|> They should have a commercial for dog blood drives. There are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and they accept donations from other dogs. <|endoftext|>
They should have a commercial for dog blood drives. There are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and they accept donations from other dogs. <|endoftext|> Yea, it be cool if the White House raised awareness for it or did a blood drive in the guest house since it is bigger than the actual White House <|endoftext|>
Yea, it be cool if the White House raised awareness for it or did a blood drive in the guest house since it is bigger than the actual White House <|endoftext|> That would be awesome.

That would be awesome. The White House should put an emphasis on environmental issues. Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed? <|endoftext|> That is a shame, maybe they could make more people aware of it with programs at the library since more than half of all US adults have a library card <|endoftext|>
That is a shame, maybe they could make more people aware of it with programs at the library since more than half of all US adults have a library card <|endoftext|> That is great that so many people use the library!

Isn't it amazing? Some Pokemon are kind of like Aliens.

I would hope they would enjoy it, otherwise it might end up like a horror movie. If I watched that film I could burn up to 180 calories. <|endoftext|> That's pretty crazy, like the runner up becoming vice president until 1805, that sounds like a horror movie <|endoftext|>
That's pretty crazy, like the runner up becoming vice president until 1805, that sounds like a horror movie <|endoftext|> Haha. It really does.

Hi. I heard an interesting fact recently. Did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington, jefferson, and jfk? <|endoftext|> Hello, they must have accomplished to people's satisfactions. <|endoftext|>
Hello, they must have accomplished to people's satisfactions. <|endoftext|> I guess so. You know, in different countries a president has different roles and functions. <|endoftext|>
I guess so. You know, in different countries a president has different roles and functions. <|endoftext|> I bet they do. The first president was named president banana in Zimbabwe. <|endoftext|>
I bet they do. The first president was named president banana in Zimbabwe. <|endoftext|> I wonder what his role was? Our country has an interesting history. I mean, up until 1805 a president's competition became his vice president. Imagine how that would be now! <|endoftext|>
I wonder what his role was? Our country has an interesting history. I mean, up until 1805 a president's competition became his vice president.

It is odd that President Harry Truman did not want a picture of him on the Dumbo ride to the Republicans. I wonder why. <|endoftext|>
I wonder that as well. There would be a lot of work. It is odd that President Harry Truman did not want a picture of him on the Dumbo ride to the Republicans. I wonder why. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! That's another interesting tid bit from history! I always heard it was so he would not be associated with republicans. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah! That's another interesting tid bit from history! I always heard it was so he would not be associated with republicans. <|endoftext|> Is there a symbolism behind dumbo? Was he embarrassed? <|endoftext|>
Is there a symbolism behind dumbo? Was he embarrassed? <|endoftext|> I assume it was because dumbo is an elephant. <|endoftext|>
I assume it was because dumbo is an elephant. <|endoftext|> This is random, but elephants represent good luck. <|endoftext|>
This is random, but elephants represent good luck. <|endoftext|> Elephants represent the republican party. Donkeys represent the democratic party. There hasn't been a president from another party besides those two in over a 100 years now. <|endoftext|>
Elephants represent the republican party. Donkeys represent the democratic party.

I was about to search it, but now I recall. Maybe he thinks that it would be an insult to the republicans. <|endoftext|> Could have been.

Right. A lot of old things from the past are still relevant today though. For example, radios can be used to pick up storms on Jupiter. <|endoftext|> That is crazy. Well, there is technology that can detect that with radio waves or electromagnetic energy. <|endoftext|>
That is crazy. Well, there is technology that can detect that with radio waves or electromagnetic energy. <|endoftext|> Yes, and radios can be so simple. Back in World War 2 soldiers made radios by using razor blades and pencils. <|endoftext|>
Yes, and radios can be so simple. Back in World War 2 soldiers made radios by using razor blades and pencils. <|endoftext|> That is interesting. They named them foxhole radios. <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. They named them foxhole radios. <|endoftext|> I guess that fits. You know, those old radio dramas are still relevant today too. There's a website the has thousands of episodes people can listen to. <|endoftext|>
I guess that fits. You know, those old radio dramas are still relevant today too. There's a website the has thousands of episodes people can listen to. <|endoftext|> Plus, they are free! <|endoftext|>
Plus, they are free! <|endoftext|> Free is always good. But radio in some countries still has to obey laws. Canada has a law for example, that all radio stations must play at least 40% of the music in Canadian. <|endoftext|>
Free is always good. But radio in some countries still has to obey laws. Canada has a law for example, that all radio stations must play at least 40% of the music in Canadian. <|endoftext|> Well, that makes sense. They have to keep their culture and heritage alive. <|endoftext|>
Well, that makes sense. They have to keep their culture and heritage alive. <|endoftext|> True. So even radios have something to do with history. <|endoftext|>
True. So even radios have something to do with history. <|endoftext|> Of course they do. It was nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|>

Oh nice. Well have you heard the highest score ever in a football game was 222-0 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland. No defense for Cumberland in that game! <|endoftext|> I would you feel if you were on the winning team ? As for I would feel kind of bad. <|endoftext|>
I would you feel if you were on the winning team ? As for I would feel kind of bad. <|endoftext|> Yeah I would feel bad too. Bad sportsmanship. Isn't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960's! <|endoftext|>
Yeah I would feel bad too. Bad sportsmanship. Isn't it odd that pro bowlers used to make more money than pro football players in the 1960's! <|endoftext|> It was another era, people had different interests.

Yea it would be funny. The fantasy genre is popular too. A janitor from Chicago wrote over six years a 15, 145 page fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor pictures! <|endoftext|> That is a lot, it would take me years to read that,. do you like the fantasy genre ? <|endoftext|>

He is very good, I think he deserved to be knighted, don't you ? <|endoftext|> Yeah I agree I think he deserved it! I think many NFL players are big celebrities. I think it's surprising there is only one left handed QB in the NFL. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I agree I think he deserved it! I think many NFL players are big celebrities. I think it's surprising there is only one left handed QB in the NFL. <|endoftext|> That is quite a statistical anomaly. Maybe coaches are used to make plays for right handed people. <|endoftext|>
That is quite a statistical anomaly. Maybe coaches are used to make plays for right handed people. <|endoftext|> Yeah that's a good point. Must not be an advantage. The circular huddle was originally developed for a deaf quarterback so the other team couldn't read his hand signals. Now everyone uses them! <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's a good point. Must not be an advantage. The circular huddle was originally developed for a deaf quarterback so the other team couldn't read his hand signals.

Imagine the other team trying to hear what they are saying if they did not know that he was deaf. It must have drive them crazy. <|endoftext|> Yeah I bet it did.The QB Baker Mayfield almost quit football to instead be a competitive video game player. I think he made the right choice to play football, he is so good. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I bet it did.The QB Baker Mayfield almost quit football to instead be a competitive video game player.

That is a terrible Superbowl. How boring. Did you know that ESPN invented the yellow line that shows the first down? Can you imagine watching a game without that? <|endoftext|> Really? I didn't know they invented it....The only thing about it is that its sometimes in accurate- remember this last super bowl where it looked like he had the first down because he crossed the yellow line but it was actually in the wrong spot? <|endoftext|>
Really? I didn't know they invented it....The only thing about it is that its sometimes in accurate- remember this last super bowl where it looked like he had the first down because he crossed the yellow line but it was actually in the wrong spot? <|endoftext|> Yes it can be deceiving but it helps.

That is a crazy score. I wonder if there is now some sort of mercy rule in place? <|endoftext|> Yeah I wonder. It's amazing how much interest in football has grown since then. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I wonder. It's amazing how much interest in football has grown since then. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. <|endoftext|> I cant believe bowler were ever paid that well. I wonder if there is a fantasy bowling league <|endoftext|>

No, I didn't know that! I think that it's good to keep up with education, no matter what other opportunities, on may have. <|endoftext|> I agree. In the 1960's, top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars. <|endoftext|>
I agree. In the 1960's, top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars. <|endoftext|> That's crazy! I've never bowled, ever!Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career. That's a great record to have! <|endoftext|>

Hey there, I found it pretty interesting that the Presidential runner-up became the Vice President until 1805 <|endoftext|> Hi. I thought that was awesome too.

Hi. I thought that was awesome too. But now they have more choice in who they can work with. I thought it was awesome that Canadian law requires radio stations to play Canadian music 40 percent of the time. <|endoftext|> Yeah that was pretty interesting too.

I thought it was interesting that the President of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office. We need more artistic expression and less politics. <|endoftext|> Totally agree.

Totally agree. Much less divisiveness in art! How about the President of Zimbabwe being called President Banana - I laughed a lot at that fact <|endoftext|> I thought the same thing. And the guest house of our President is larger than the White House. I had no idea! <|endoftext|>
I thought the same thing. And the guest house of our President is larger than the White House. I had no idea! <|endoftext|> I think I may have heard that before, but I could be making stuff up haha.

I would have to see if that fact is really true with Wikipedia even thought I trust our requestor friends. I thought some of the facts about radios were wild. The fact that Jupitar has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio. I thought they were going to tie back radios to when earlier Presidents started to talk to the public on them but the fact section didn't. <|endoftext|>

You think so? I think he hates being president and can't wait to be a civilian. Do you think he will just continue the trump empire? <|endoftext|> No, I think he's putting the US back on the right track and he's doing so for his kids and his children's kids.

Do you mind the way he does it? I lean more republican, based on being financially conservative, and I do not like how he seems to lie and pervert the truth. <|endoftext|> Nah, not a bit. People are so quick to criticize his every move. He don't talk the right way. He just lays it on the line. This is what needs to be done, let's do it. No, we're not going to talk about it for 10 years and then vote. We're going to do something now. Lots of people respond to that. Career Washington doesn't know how to take him, but I can guarantee you, Main Street America, the working man, knows exactly what he's talking about. <|endoftext|>

Hi, how are you? What bothers you the most about him? <|endoftext|> Too long a list, but mostly his constant lies or over exaggerations of the truth. He appears to have a problem with everybody. <|endoftext|>
Too long a list, but mostly his constant lies or over exaggerations of the truth. He appears to have a problem with everybody. <|endoftext|> Some are saying that despite these problem he will get re-elected because he is steadily improving his game. <|endoftext|>
Some are saying that despite these problem he will get re-elected because he is steadily improving his game. <|endoftext|> Well he is certainly learning to speak better, but most of that is the writers. If he does learn to be more political then He may have a chance. <|endoftext|>
Well he is certainly learning to speak better, but most of that is the writers. If he does learn to be more political then He may have a chance. <|endoftext|> He's not educated the way Woodrow Wilson is, the only president to have a PhD.

He certainly has been on the tube a lot in, to quote him, " The highest rated show in history". <|endoftext|> He proves that there is no bad publicity. Guatemala seems to have a good idea about the presidency. Close relatives of former presidents cannot legally run for president. That might allow new blood into the race in the US.

LOL. Did you know the trunk of car came about because older cars used to have wooden trunks? <|endoftext|> I heard that. Can you imagine what that would look like. <|endoftext|>
I heard that. Can you imagine what that would look like. <|endoftext|> I bet it would look very weird to us. Cadillac was actually named after a French explorer. <|endoftext|>
I bet it would look very weird to us. Cadillac was actually named after a French explorer. <|endoftext|> Yeah, his name was antoine de la mothe cadillac <|endoftext|>
Yeah, his name was antoine de la mothe cadillac <|endoftext|> Apparently, he also founded Detroit which is really interesting. <|endoftext|>
Apparently, he also founded Detroit which is really interesting. <|endoftext|> Yeah He sure got around back in the day huh. <|endoftext|>
Yeah He sure got around back in the day huh. <|endoftext|> For sure lol. It is legal in South Africa to equip a flame thrower to a car to prevent carjacking. <|endoftext|>
For sure lol. It is legal in South Africa to equip a flame thrower to a car to prevent carjacking. <|endoftext|> That would surely deter me. Lol. <|endoftext|>
That would surely deter me. Lol. <|endoftext|> Me too lol. Do you know much about telephones? <|endoftext|>
Me too lol. Do you know much about telephones? <|endoftext|> I know that an iphone has more computing power than the us nuclear icbm deterent. <|endoftext|>
I know that an iphone has more computing power than the us nuclear icbm deterent. <|endoftext|> That is a little scary. Hard to believe too. <|endoftext|>
That is a little scary. Hard to believe too. <|endoftext|> Did you know that jupiter has rakio storms. <|endoftext|>
Did you know that jupiter has rakio storms. <|endoftext|> I have heard that before. Hard to believe you can hear the radio storms here on Earth. <|endoftext|>
I have heard that before. Hard to believe you can hear the radio storms here on Earth. <|endoftext|> Yeah I kind of want to find that station and listen to it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I kind of want to find that station and listen to it. <|endoftext|> That would be really cool. New York's area code of 212 was established because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. <|endoftext|>
That would be really cool. New York's area code of 212 was established because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. <|endoftext|> Makes sense to me. Although it doesnt take that long to dial a longer number. <|endoftext|>
Makes sense to me. Although it doesnt take that long to dial a longer number. <|endoftext|> I agree. The cables carrying phone and data lines across the ocean are only 2.7 inches in diameter. <|endoftext|>
I agree. The cables carrying phone and data lines across the ocean are only 2.7 inches in diameter. <|endoftext|> Thats actually pretty amazing. I always picture these huge wire running on the bottom of the ocean <|endoftext|>
Thats actually pretty amazing. I always picture these huge wire running on the bottom of the ocean <|endoftext|> Me too. Well it was great talking to you. <|endoftext|>
Me too. Well it was great talking to you. <|endoftext|> Good afternoon. Do you like cars? I think the 1908 model T was a classic because it was the first car available to everyone! <|endoftext|>
Good afternoon. Do you like cars? I think the 1908 model T was a classic because it was the first car available to everyone! <|endoftext|> I drive a car so I suppose I do. More out of necessity than anything else. <|endoftext|>
I drive a car so I suppose I do. More out of necessity than anything else. <|endoftext|> Yes it definitely gets people from point A to point B. The trunk of the car is called that because old cars used to have actual wooden trunks on the back. <|endoftext|>
Yes it definitely gets people from point A to point B. The trunk of the car is called that because old cars used to have actual wooden trunks on the back. <|endoftext|> I'm originally from the UK, there it is called the boot, I wonder if they had an old boot strapped to the back before. <|endoftext|>
I'm originally from the UK, there it is called the boot, I wonder if they had an old boot strapped to the back before. <|endoftext|> Oh that's cool. I've been there a few times. Yes that would be funny. The brand Cadillac was named after the French explorer who found Detroit! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's cool. I've been there a few times. Yes that would be funny. The brand Cadillac was named after the French explorer who found Detroit! <|endoftext|> I wonder why they used that name. I guess because he is associated with the city. Cars and Detroit used to go hand in hand, but not so much now. <|endoftext|>
I wonder why they used that name. I guess because he is associated with the city. Cars and Detroit used to go hand in hand, but not so much now. <|endoftext|> Yeah you're right, but now that city is in ruin from what I've heard. it is not like south Africa where it is legal to put flamethrowers on your car. <|endoftext|>
Yeah you're right, but now that city is in ruin from what I've heard. it is not like south Africa where it is legal to put flamethrowers on your car. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a crazy idea, I guess if you want others to get out of your way quickly, or if someone is going too slow in front of you, it might be useful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a crazy idea, I guess if you want others to get out of your way quickly, or if someone is going too slow in front of you, it might be useful. <|endoftext|> Yes actually I think it was meant to deter carjacking because that must be a big problem there. <|endoftext|>
Yes actually I think it was meant to deter carjacking because that must be a big problem there. <|endoftext|> Not that I was ever likely to go to South Africa, but that may be another reason for me to avoid it. I don't think I need to ask an advice columnist for that help. <|endoftext|>
Not that I was ever likely to go to South Africa, but that may be another reason for me to avoid it. I don't think I need to ask an advice columnist for that help. <|endoftext|> Yes good call.

Yes good call. Do you like it in the drive-through? It was invented in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues. <|endoftext|> I like those old fashioned ones where you'd pull up and use a telephone to call your order in. <|endoftext|>
I like those old fashioned ones where you'd pull up and use a telephone to call your order in. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah those are awesome. You can just wait for your food and listen to the radio. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by a.m. radio. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah those are awesome. You can just wait for your food and listen to the radio. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by a.m. radio. <|endoftext|> I can imagine that after listening to that for a couple of minutes you might want to change the channel, even something in Latin sounds better than that. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that after listening to that for a couple of minutes you might want to change the channel, even something in Latin sounds better than that. <|endoftext|> Ha ha yes I agree. In Canada all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian. <|endoftext|>

Yes I agree. Isn't it interesting that soldiers in World War II made a radio using just the razor blade and a pencil? <|endoftext|> More inventive that I'd ever be. I suppose they were trying to stay in touch with those storms on Jupiter. <|endoftext|>
More inventive that I'd ever be. I suppose they were trying to stay in touch with those storms on Jupiter. <|endoftext|> Yes probably so LOL. Do you like radio dramas? There's a website where you can listen to thousands for free. <|endoftext|>
Yes probably so LOL. Do you like radio dramas? There's a website where you can listen to thousands for free. <|endoftext|> I think I prefer my dramas on TV, if they are free maybe I'll give it a go. I might be missing out on something. <|endoftext|>
I think I prefer my dramas on TV, if they are free maybe I'll give it a go. I might be missing out on something. <|endoftext|> Yes they can be a little boring I think.

Even with powerful machines like monster trucks from the monster truck rally? <|endoftext|> Well, I'm not sure about that, but I would imagine that it's quite difficult.

Well, I'm not sure about that, but I would imagine that it's quite difficult.

There are no beasties down there to disturb the cables in their gentle slumber. They do their jobs unmolested. That's great! <|endoftext|> Yeah, very true haha. It's also quite surprising that an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, very true haha. It's also quite surprising that an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent. <|endoftext|> The ICBM is woefully out of date.

Is that what the kids are doing these days? listening to storms on Jupiter? In my day we listened to the sun. I guess that just isn't "cool" enough for kids. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I guess times change.

Yeah, I guess times change. It's kind of funny because there was a time when soldiers made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them foxhole radios. <|endoftext|> I guess soldiers in foxholes didnt have much else to do but pray and make radios. <|endoftext|>
I guess soldiers in foxholes didnt have much else to do but pray and make radios. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, it was nice talking to you. I don't see a "Done" button anywhere, do you? <|endoftext|>

The White House got burned down during the War of 1812, so some Prez was put out of gov't housing for a while. Perhaps there was a guest house then. <|endoftext|> Probably so! The guest house now is bigger than the White House itself. <|endoftext|>

Hello there, it sounds like he was a brave man who sacrificed himself for the good of others. <|endoftext|> He definitely was, like so many who serve. After Navy officer fell from the helicopter Chapman and others decided to go back for him, even knowing it was dangerous. He does deserve the medal. <|endoftext|>
He definitely was, like so many who serve. After Navy officer fell from the helicopter Chapman and others decided to go back for him, even knowing it was dangerous. He does deserve the medal. <|endoftext|> Yes I agree, he certainly does. His family should be proud of his actions. <|endoftext|>
Yes I agree, he certainly does. His family should be proud of his actions. <|endoftext|> Definitely, interesting story for sure, Chapman will be the 1st member of the Air Force to get the medal of honor. ...he was the only American alive at the top of that mountain,fighting.... how terrifying. <|endoftext|>
Definitely, interesting story for sure, Chapman will be the 1st member of the Air Force to get the medal of honor. ...he was the only American alive at the top of that mountain,fighting.... how terrifying. <|endoftext|> That that would be extremely terrifying, probably running on pure adrenaline at that point. <|endoftext|>
That that would be extremely terrifying, probably running on pure adrenaline at that point. <|endoftext|> Exactly, I could not imagine the fear. I am sure the entire country including the president were very proud. <|endoftext|>

Very interesting. I wonder if other presidents have White House type residence. I know there are 2 other white houses in Ireland and France. <|endoftext|> That is funny, I also wonder if their guest houses are also larger than the white house. <|endoftext|>
That is funny, I also wonder if their guest houses are also larger than the white house. <|endoftext|> I wonder that too, makes me curious to know why the guest house at the White house is so big, I thought the White House looks very large, so that guest house must be huge lol <|endoftext|>
I wonder that too, makes me curious to know why the guest house at the White house is so big, I thought the White House looks very large, so that guest house must be huge lol <|endoftext|> Right, and I wonder what guests think when they come to stay here. <|endoftext|>
Right, and I wonder what guests think when they come to stay here. <|endoftext|> Probably pretty comfortable for sure! The White House has been home for every president since the 1800's so I wonder if that guest house was there back then or not. <|endoftext|>
Probably pretty comfortable for sure! The White House has been home for every president since the 1800's so I wonder if that guest house was there back then or not. <|endoftext|> I bet there was one, but not nearly the size it is today. <|endoftext|>
I bet there was one, but not nearly the size it is today. <|endoftext|> I would like to know who had the guest house built, interesting part of history. They even have solar panels so I am sure it has been changed throughout the years many times. <|endoftext|>

Yeah it sounds like some presidents have taken them down, and then they are put back up again, sounds silly to me. <|endoftext|> Right! lol, they should just stay put. I am sure each president has done some type of remodeling to the White House. I wonder if they have music streaming into any of the rooms of the White House.....I am sure there must be relaxing rooms there so they can sit back and listen to the radio and put their feet up lol <|endoftext|>

That's pretty cool, I wonder if FDR ever talked with President Banana of Zimbabwe <|endoftext|> No clue!

No clue! That's a interesting name, it's always funny hearing about customs in other presidential elections.

Sounds like a good rule, up until 1805 the runner up of the US election became vice president <|endoftext|> That's interesting! It's probably a change for the better too.

That's interesting! It's probably a change for the better too. I think one change should be needing a certain level of education, like I believe the only president to have a phD was Woodrow Wilson. <|endoftext|> Yea education is important.

Yea education is important. Maybe they could change the White House's size so it's guest house isn't larger <|endoftext|> Ahah that's interesting, I never knew the guest house was bigger. Although I'm sure it doesn't have solar panels like the White House does. <|endoftext|>
Ahah that's interesting, I never knew the guest house was bigger. Although I'm sure it doesn't have solar panels like the White House does. <|endoftext|> I heard the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France, I wonder how similar they are to the US <|endoftext|>

I never knew that! Maybe it's more common of a thing than we think, I believe someone had a replica of it built in Atlanta, to use as a private home. <|endoftext|> Sounds expensive, hopefully it is more up to date than the official white house, they still use floppy disks <|endoftext|>
Sounds expensive, hopefully it is more up to date than the official white house, they still use floppy disks <|endoftext|> That definitely seems like old technology.

That definitely seems like old technology.

That's pretty nice but maybe they should change their priorities considering in 2011 the Secret Service didn't realize someone shot the white house for 4 days <|endoftext|> That's crazy!

That's pretty cool, at least they allow Christmas trees back in the White House since Teddy Roosevelt banned them <|endoftext|> That seems unprofessional!

hahha that is true. I like Jim Carrey. Do you know why he stopped making dramas? <|endoftext|> Yes he only wanted to promote positivity. So he stopped doing dramas actually. I actually think some of his best movies were dramas. For instance I really like The Truman Show <|endoftext|>
Yes he only wanted to promote positivity. So he stopped doing dramas actually. I actually think some of his best movies were dramas. For instance I really like The Truman Show <|endoftext|> Oh I see why. Do you watch the show on netflix or elsewhere? <|endoftext|>

The owner was slapped with a late fee for a VHS and was not happy about it <|endoftext|> You know that does sound familiar. I think I did watch something about that.

That was not a good decision. They could have bought it for $50 million and make billions now <|endoftext|> Bad decision on their part, but I am thankful they didn't buy it. We might get late fees somehow from them for using netflix. They could have bought it for $50 million and they'd be worth $2 billion now. <|endoftext|>
Bad decision on their part, but I am thankful they didn't buy it. We might get late fees somehow from them for using netflix.

Greetings! Are you a Netflix user by any chance? I just learned that Netflix accounts for a third of all internet bandwidth between 9 p.m. and midnight.

Ain't much on TV these days. Folks want quality entertainment. Youtube also sucks up tons of bandwidth. <|endoftext|> That's true -- about YouTube. But I've been amazed by the growth of Netflix. There's almost no country it's not in, the exceptions being places like China and North Korea. <|endoftext|>
That's true -- about YouTube. But I've been amazed by the growth of Netflix. There's almost no country it's not in, the exceptions being places like China and North Korea. <|endoftext|> The Chinese gov't doesn't want imperial influence within its borders. <|endoftext|>
The Chinese gov't doesn't want imperial influence within its borders. <|endoftext|> So, you said folks want quality entertainment. Do you drama? It's one of the oldest forms of fiction, dating back to the time of Aristotle. <|endoftext|>
So, you said folks want quality entertainment. Do you drama? It's one of the oldest forms of fiction, dating back to the time of Aristotle. <|endoftext|> Drama is great. But do actors choose drama because they like drama or because they like the actors? Michael Caine had ulterior motives. <|endoftext|>
Drama is great. But do actors choose drama because they like drama or because they like the actors? Michael Caine had ulterior motives. <|endoftext|> Yes, I've heard about his motives. ;-) But, whatever, he's a great actor. Jim Carrey, meanwhile, doesn't do drama anymore because he wants to be in films that project positivity. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I've heard about his motives. ;-) But, whatever, he's a great actor. Jim Carrey, meanwhile, doesn't do drama anymore because he wants to be in films that project positivity. <|endoftext|> I think that dramas CAN project positivity. People don't need to laugh. They need to feel good. <|endoftext|>
I think that dramas CAN project positivity. People don't need to laugh. They need to feel good. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen "Rise" on NBC? It's about kids who want to put on a show -- kind of a tired meme. But the show has some good talent like Auli'i Cravalho. <|endoftext|>
Have you ever seen "Rise" on NBC? It's about kids who want to put on a show -- kind of a tired meme. But the show has some good talent like Auli'i Cravalho. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it. I guess the producers are hoping to draw a young audience <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen it. I guess the producers are hoping to draw a young audience <|endoftext|> Yes, that's the way of all mass media. If they don't get a young audience, then there's no future for them. "Rise" is situated in a high school and focuses on the students in the theatre department, kind of like how "Glee" dealt with the kids in the glee club. <|endoftext|>

"Rise" is situated in a high school and focuses on the students in the theatre department, kind of like how "Glee" dealt with the kids in the glee club. <|endoftext|> Gotcha. I don't know Glee, but I can imagine the cast already. A multi-ethnic bunch dealing with parents and teachers. But Rise is drama about the drama club. Very dramatic. <|endoftext|>
Gotcha. I don't know Glee, but I can imagine the cast already. A multi-ethnic bunch dealing with parents and teachers. But Rise is drama about the drama club. Very dramatic. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen "Rise," just read about it. The shows seem related. "Rise" features a football player who is cast in the lead of a musical. "Glee" had a football player who became the standout male lead singer. <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen "Rise," just read about it. The shows seem related. "Rise" features a football player who is cast in the lead of a musical. "Glee" had a football player who became the standout male lead singer. <|endoftext|> Yes, that seems obvious, since we all know that football players are selected for their singing talent. In the singing competitions, did the Glee folks paint the visitor locker room pink, like University of Iowa? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that seems obvious, since we all know that football players are selected for their singing talent. In the singing competitions, did the Glee folks paint the visitor locker room pink, like University of Iowa? <|endoftext|> Ha! No, I don't think so. That would be something to see. I wonder if they do that in other countries where they have something called "football"? Ever seen Australian rules? Beats American football. <|endoftext|>
Ha! No, I don't think so. That would be something to see. I wonder if they do that in other countries where they have something called "football"? Ever seen Australian rules? Beats American football. <|endoftext|> Never seen it. Pads, helmets, the works? Just as violent? <|endoftext|>
Never seen it. Pads, helmets, the works? Just as violent? <|endoftext|> It's Australian. I think they have pads on their knees, some of them. But no helmets or other padding. And probably players get hurt a lot more. I think it's closer to rugby. <|endoftext|>
It's Australian. I think they have pads on their knees, some of them. But no helmets or other padding. And probably players get hurt a lot more. I think it's closer to rugby. <|endoftext|> I guess those Australians are just naturally violent types. I wonder how much bowlers in Australia made in the 1960s compared to football players. <|endoftext|>
I guess those Australians are just naturally violent types. I wonder how much bowlers in Australia made in the 1960s compared to football players. <|endoftext|> Hmm, I don't know. But now I'm wondering if there's an Australian version of "Glee" or "Rise" starring an Australian rules player who also sings and/or acts. Now that would be quite the drama! <|endoftext|>
Hmm, I don't know. But now I'm wondering if there's an Australian version of "Glee" or "Rise" starring an Australian rules player who also sings and/or acts. Now that would be quite the drama! <|endoftext|> Lots of violence in the drama club, and no helmets for protection! Oh, the drama! It's funny that Blockbuster declined offers to buy Netflix for $50 million. What an oversight! <|endoftext|>
Lots of violence in the drama club, and no helmets for protection! Oh, the drama! It's funny that Blockbuster declined offers to buy Netflix for $50 million. What an oversight! <|endoftext|> Yup. The company's worth a lot more now -- about $2 billion! <|endoftext|>
Yup. The company's worth a lot more now -- about $2 billion! <|endoftext|> Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! <|endoftext|>

The Raptors are doing good, maybe they'll bring the championship to Canada <|endoftext|> I feel like this is their year. They always have problems in the playoffs but this years team is their best. Did you know NBA players are the worlds best paid athletes? <|endoftext|>
I feel like this is their year. They always have problems in the playoffs but this years team is their best. Did you know NBA players are the worlds best paid athletes? <|endoftext|> Yea nba players get paid good but its a shame 60% of them go broke 2 years after retirement <|endoftext|>
Yea nba players get paid good but its a shame 60% of them go broke 2 years after retirement <|endoftext|> That is crazy. You'd think the NBAPA would hire people to help manage it's players money since they clearly can't do it on their own. In addition to their salaries basketball players seem to get more endorsements then other athletes. Allen Iverson's reebok contract pays him until he is 55! <|endoftext|>

In addition to their salaries basketball players seem to get more endorsements then other athletes. Allen Iverson's reebok contract pays him until he is 55! <|endoftext|> That's pretty insane. Spencer Haywood declined a 10% in Nike for 100,000 dollars for his shoe deal <|endoftext|>
That's pretty insane. Spencer Haywood declined a 10% in Nike for 100,000 dollars for his shoe deal <|endoftext|> Imagine how much he'd have now? Although players like him and Jordan are the exception. The regular plays probably get modest sponsorship and once they are no longer playing don't know what to do with their money, then it's gone for good. <|endoftext|>
Imagine how much he'd have now? Although players like him and Jordan are the exception. The regular plays probably get modest sponsorship and once they are no longer playing don't know what to do with their money, then it's gone for good. <|endoftext|> Well if Haywood took the 10% he have 8.62 billion worth in Nike <|endoftext|>
Well if Haywood took the 10% he have 8.62 billion worth in Nike <|endoftext|> WOW! That is a shame. You said you are a Knicks fan, have you ever been to the NBA head office in NY? <|endoftext|>
WOW! That is a shame. You said you are a Knicks fan, have you ever been to the NBA head office in NY? <|endoftext|> No but maybe I'll check it out on Fifth Avenue next time I'm in NYC <|endoftext|>
No but maybe I'll check it out on Fifth Avenue next time I'm in NYC <|endoftext|> I'm just wondering if it's worth going to. Probably is. The NBA TV studios is not too far away too but I think it's on the jersey side. <|endoftext|>
I'm just wondering if it's worth going to. Probably is. The NBA TV studios is not too far away too but I think it's on the jersey side. <|endoftext|> I'd really like to go check out a football game, out of the 32 teams I love watching the Giants <|endoftext|>
I'd really like to go check out a football game, out of the 32 teams I love watching the Giants <|endoftext|> You know I've never been to an NFL game either, it's not quite as exciting as basketball with only an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game that lasts hours. <|endoftext|>
You know I've never been to an NFL game either, it's not quite as exciting as basketball with only an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game that lasts hours. <|endoftext|> Especially if you're a Browns fan, since 1999 Ben Rothlesburger has the most wins as a qb in their stadium <|endoftext|>
Especially if you're a Browns fan, since 1999 Ben Rothlesburger has the most wins as a qb in their stadium <|endoftext|> The NFL has a lot of weird rules too.

The NFL has a lot of weird rules too. Apparently if saints cheerleaders are eating in a restaurant and a player comes in they have to leave since they aren't allowed to eat in the same place. <|endoftext|> That's a shame, how would they even know, it's not like they put tracking chips in the cheerleaders like they do in the players' equipment <|endoftext|>
That's a shame, how would they even know, it's not like they put tracking chips in the cheerleaders like they do in the players' equipment <|endoftext|> Who knows. You always hear about NFL players being fined for random things too. I think I'll stick with mostly watching NBA games. <|endoftext|>
Who knows. You always hear about NFL players being fined for random things too. I think I'll stick with mostly watching NBA games. <|endoftext|> Yea, the NFL has changed a lot since they started in 1932 <|endoftext|>
Yea, the NFL has changed a lot since they started in 1932 <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know the NFL was that old. I always thought it was the newest major sports league, but the NBA only started in 1946. <|endoftext|>

That is smart. It always surprises me that Air Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA. <|endoftext|> Me too! Luckily Nike decided to pay the fines, otherwise I don't know where they would be today! <|endoftext|>
Me too! Luckily Nike decided to pay the fines, otherwise I don't know where they would be today! <|endoftext|> Yeah, and those shoe deals are valuable! I know Alan Iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with Reebok. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, and those shoe deals are valuable! I know Alan Iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with Reebok. <|endoftext|> I bet he can't wait until he turns 55 to get that lump sum payment of 32 million dollars! <|endoftext|>
I bet he can't wait until he turns 55 to get that lump sum payment of 32 million dollars! <|endoftext|> Yeah. That's a lot, but so is the $800k a year he's been getting since 2001. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. That's a lot, but so is the $800k a year he's been getting since 2001. <|endoftext|> Yet he is still saying he's always broke haha. Do you watch football as well? I can't believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay! <|endoftext|>
Yet he is still saying he's always broke haha. Do you watch football as well? I can't believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay! <|endoftext|> Yes, I watch all of the time.

Yes, I watch all of the time. I can not believe that the league has no rules against female players as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements! <|endoftext|> It would be nice to see a woman tryout someday! I wonder if there has been and we just don't know? <|endoftext|>
It would be nice to see a woman tryout someday! I wonder if there has been and we just don't know? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'm not sure if it is publicized. It's odd they allow females to join, yet the Saints still have what seems like sexist rules for their cheerleaders. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm not sure if it is publicized. It's odd they allow females to join, yet the Saints still have what seems like sexist rules for their cheerleaders. <|endoftext|> I couldn't imagine how they would feel if they just ordered a nice meal and had to leave!

I couldn't imagine how they would feel if they just ordered a nice meal and had to leave! I wonder if the NBA does that too! <|endoftext|> I'm not sure. Can you believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL or MLB player? <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure. Can you believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL or MLB player? <|endoftext|> I believe it. You have to think, some players only play 2-3 years and make the rookie salary! Go Engineers! Haha, I wonder how they pair up with basketball players? <|endoftext|>
I believe it. You have to think, some players only play 2-3 years and make the rookie salary! Go Engineers! Haha, I wonder how they pair up with basketball players? <|endoftext|> Well, that is true.I can not believe football is so advanced! Did you know they use tracking devices? <|endoftext|>
Well, that is true.I can not believe football is so advanced! Did you know they use tracking devices? <|endoftext|> I did hear that! Is it just to see a players every move? <|endoftext|>
I did hear that! Is it just to see a players every move? <|endoftext|> Yes! The NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. <|endoftext|>
Yes! The NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. <|endoftext|> Don't they do that with the footballs too? In terms of things like velocity and rotation? <|endoftext|>
Don't they do that with the footballs too? In terms of things like velocity and rotation? <|endoftext|> They sure do. Sounds like they keep track of everything that is going on. <|endoftext|>

Yes, I am a huge fan as a matter of fact! But knowing the highest paid employee in 39 states are either college football or basketball coaches is shocking.

Yeah, I was shocked too. It is just State employees so that does not count the under the table money the players get lol. <|endoftext|> You may be right about that. Ha!

You may be right about that. Ha! I also think it's shocking college basketball banned the dunk shot for more than a decade thanks to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He must have been one powerful dunker! <|endoftext|> I bet the attendence went down for that year haha and they changed their minds. <|endoftext|>
I bet the attendence went down for that year haha and they changed their minds. <|endoftext|> Probably so! I tell you what would make attendance go down is if a team in the US was called the "Tall Blacks" like that team over in New Zealand is. I don't see how they get away with such a racist name! <|endoftext|>
Probably so! I tell you what would make attendance go down is if a team in the US was called the "Tall Blacks" like that team over in New Zealand is. I don't see how they get away with such a racist name! <|endoftext|> No, its a pun on the Rugby team the All Blacks because they wear all black. <|endoftext|>
No, its a pun on the Rugby team the All Blacks because they wear all black. <|endoftext|> That would make a little more sense. On another basketball note, did you know the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is also the University of Kansas' only losing coach in its entire history? Thats a little ironic! <|endoftext|>
That would make a little more sense. On another basketball note, did you know the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is also the University of Kansas' only losing coach in its entire history?

Yeah the All Blacks are legends so they stole their name. Naismith should have taught granny style shooting to help <|endoftext|> Ha! Maybe he should have! So did you also know there's actually a basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building which is called the highest court in the land? <|endoftext|>
Ha! Maybe he should have! So did you also know there's actually a basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building which is called the highest court in the land? <|endoftext|> Very neat! I would like to see that. Do you like football too? <|endoftext|>
Very neat! I would like to see that. Do you like football too? <|endoftext|> I do love football, especially the NFL! Although I don't like how there's only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average each game. I wish it was longer. What about you? <|endoftext|>
I do love football, especially the NFL! Although I don't like how there's only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average each game. I wish it was longer. What about you? <|endoftext|> Love it. Lots of trades going on! I did not know there were chips in the balls? <|endoftext|>
Love it. Lots of trades going on! I did not know there were chips in the balls? <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, and they also stick tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads as well to record their every move! That is so innovative! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, and they also stick tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads as well to record their every move! That is so innovative! <|endoftext|> How come they make so many bad calls then? Did you know espn invented the yellow line? <|endoftext|>
How come they make so many bad calls then? Did you know espn invented the yellow line? <|endoftext|> Did they really? Now that is innovative! Speaking of the NFL, I can't help but wonder why they haven't signed a female player yet seeing as how there are no rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. You'd think we would have at least had a female kicker by now! <|endoftext|>

I agree. There are some female soccer player who can kick the ball like crazy! Did you know Saint Cheerleaders have to leave a restuarant if a player walks in? <|endoftext|> I can't believe no lawsuits have been filed over that misogynistic rule yet. But regarding female players, if they do it simply for the money, then they should just enter the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway. <|endoftext|>

But regarding female players, if they do it simply for the money, then they should just enter the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway. <|endoftext|> Yeah, NFL careers are short.

Good point...take care and nice chat! <|endoftext|> And additionally, look at the endorsement deals, such as the lifetime deal Allen Iverson signed with Reebok! He gets $800k a year until he hits 55, then he gets a final lump sum payment of $32 million. NBA is definitely where the money is at! Ha! Well, you take care as well, friend!

Yes its important to have an education. <|endoftext|> Yes indeed. I think I read somewhere that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than those of an NFL or NBA player.

Sure is. Here's an interesting fact. In South Africa it is legal to carry flame throwers in your car to prevent carjacking. <|endoftext|> Wow, they don't play do they? Even so, back in the day the car brand Cadillac was names after french explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac who actually founded Detroit. Interesting Fact! <|endoftext|>
Wow, they don't play do they? Even so, back in the day the car brand Cadillac was names after french explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac who actually founded Detroit. Interesting Fact! <|endoftext|> I love Cadillacs. I also love the Benz birthed in 1886 as a modern car. <|endoftext|>
I love Cadillacs. I also love the Benz birthed in 1886 as a modern car. <|endoftext|> Yes, actually the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of modern cars when Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent Motor Wagon. <|endoftext|>
Yes, actually the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of modern cars when Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent Motor Wagon. <|endoftext|> Love them! Kudos to McDonald's who added a drive thru in 1975 for soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars because of their fatigues. <|endoftext|>
Love them! Kudos to McDonald's who added a drive thru in 1975 for soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars because of their fatigues. <|endoftext|> Yes, that was a very smart move on their part. Made them a lot of money since then. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|>
Yes, that was a very smart move on their part. Made them a lot of money since then. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|> I travel when I get the chance. Do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>
I travel when I get the chance. Do you like to travel? <|endoftext|> Yes I like to travel, I've been many places. <|endoftext|>
Yes I like to travel, I've been many places. <|endoftext|> Did you know that the Dutch are creating a train that will travel 160 MPH? <|endoftext|>
Did you know that the Dutch are creating a train that will travel 160 MPH? <|endoftext|> No I did not know that. But I do know about that hearse that carried Rosa Parks and Aretha Franklin. That thing was dope! <|endoftext|>
No I did not know that. But I do know about that hearse that carried Rosa Parks and Aretha Franklin. That thing was dope! <|endoftext|> I did not know about that. Can you elaborate? <|endoftext|>
I did not know about that. Can you elaborate? <|endoftext|> It was a white hearse from the 40's with a vintage slope to the back. <|endoftext|>
It was a white hearse from the 40's with a vintage slope to the back. <|endoftext|> And the exact same one carried both in their funeral processions? <|endoftext|>
And the exact same one carried both in their funeral processions? <|endoftext|> Yes, it was the same vehicle. I'd love to have one carry me one day, just like that. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it was the same vehicle. I'd love to have one carry me one day, just like that. <|endoftext|> That's pretty amazing. Speaking of cars, did you know that McDonald's invented the drive-thru? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty amazing. Speaking of cars, did you know that McDonald's invented the drive-thru? <|endoftext|> really? i didnt but it makes sense. <|endoftext|>
really? i didnt but it makes sense. <|endoftext|> It was to accommodate soldiers because they could not get out of their cars in their fatigues. <|endoftext|>
It was to accommodate soldiers because they could not get out of their cars in their fatigues. <|endoftext|> that makes no sense <|endoftext|>
that makes no sense <|endoftext|> I don't know why they were not allowed to exit their vehicle in fatigues at the time. Do you know why the trunk of your car is called a trunk? <|endoftext|>
I don't know why they were not allowed to exit their vehicle in fatigues at the time. Do you know why the trunk of your car is called a trunk? <|endoftext|> Because its' the back end. Just like a butt. Did you know it's illegal to warm up your car in Ohio? <|endoftext|>
Because its' the back end. Just like a butt. Did you know it's illegal to warm up your car in Ohio? <|endoftext|> It's actually because there used to be actual wooden trunks in the back. I did not. That seems crazy because I live in Ohio and we all warm up our cars. You couldn't see in the winter if you didn't. <|endoftext|>
It's actually because there used to be actual wooden trunks in the back. I did not. That seems crazy because I live in Ohio and we all warm up our cars. You couldn't see in the winter if you didn't. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, that's wild <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's wild <|endoftext|> Do you know why the Cadillac is called a Cadillac? <|endoftext|>
Do you know why the Cadillac is called a Cadillac? <|endoftext|> Isn't it named after an indian chief? <|endoftext|>
Isn't it named after an indian chief? <|endoftext|> It's named after the founder of Detroit Antoine De La Mothe. <|endoftext|>
It's named after the founder of Detroit Antoine De La Mothe. <|endoftext|> Where is Cadillac in his name then? <|endoftext|>
Where is Cadillac in his name then? <|endoftext|> Sorry I left the last name off Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|>
Sorry I left the last name off Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|> Hi! Do you like sports? I really like football and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy the super bowl game, but I do like the quarterback, Tom Brady. <|endoftext|>
Hi! Do you like sports? I really like football and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy the super bowl game, but I do like the quarterback, Tom Brady. <|endoftext|> I like some sports. I did watch the Super Bowl and it was crazy boring. I'm not a Brady fan but I respect his talent. Are you familiar with Alex Smith? <|endoftext|>
I like some sports. I did watch the Super Bowl and it was crazy boring. I'm not a Brady fan but I respect his talent. Are you familiar with Alex Smith? <|endoftext|> It really was crazy boring but yeah, I do think Brady is a great player. No I'm not familiar with Alex Smith, is he a quarterback as well? <|endoftext|>
It really was crazy boring but yeah, I do think Brady is a great player. No I'm not familiar with Alex Smith, is he a quarterback as well? <|endoftext|> He was until he was injured. He took so many AP tests in high school that he entered college as a junior. That's pretty impressive. <|endoftext|>
He was until he was injured. He took so many AP tests in high school that he entered college as a junior. That's pretty impressive. <|endoftext|> Yeah, that is impressive, to my understanding, it seems like education comes second to sports for these great athletes, but not the case for Alex Smith and also for Baker Mayfield. He's also a great competitive gamer, claiming he can beat anyone in Halo. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is impressive, to my understanding, it seems like education comes second to sports for these great athletes, but not the case for Alex Smith and also for Baker Mayfield. He's also a great competitive gamer, claiming he can beat anyone in Halo. <|endoftext|> I agree. Smith was already working on his Master's when drafted. I heard that Mayfield considered quitting to become a professional video game competitor. <|endoftext|>
I agree. Smith was already working on his Master's when drafted. I heard that Mayfield considered quitting to become a professional video game competitor. <|endoftext|> Wow, to get his master's! That's almost unheard of for professional athletes! I would like to see if women will ever make it to the NFL since there is no official rule against female players. I wonder how the public would respond to that. <|endoftext|>
Wow, to get his master's! That's almost unheard of for professional athletes! I would like to see if women will ever make it to the NFL since there is no official rule against female players. I wonder how the public would respond to that. <|endoftext|> As much as I'd love to see that I don't know many that would meet the physical requirements going against such large players. I would like to see a female team that's not just exploitation like the lingerie bowl. <|endoftext|>
As much as I'd love to see that I don't know many that would meet the physical requirements going against such large players. I would like to see a female team that's not just exploitation like the lingerie bowl. <|endoftext|> There is such a thing as lingerie bowl? Yeah, the physical requirements are pretty high, even when games average only 11 minutes of live game play, I think football is still a pretty aggressive sport. <|endoftext|>
There is such a thing as lingerie bowl? Yeah, the physical requirements are pretty high, even when games average only 11 minutes of live game play, I think football is still a pretty aggressive sport. <|endoftext|> Yes. They are athletic women for sure but they put them in basically bras and panties. It's always rubbed me the wrong way. I also don't like the sexist way the Saints treat their cheerleaders. <|endoftext|>
Yes. They are athletic women for sure but they put them in basically bras and panties. It's always rubbed me the wrong way. I also don't like the sexist way the Saints treat their cheerleaders. <|endoftext|> Oh I see, wow, that seems pretty sexist to me already! How do the Saints treat their cheerleaders? I hope they don't use tracking chips like they do in players to record the players every move. <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, wow, that seems pretty sexist to me already! How do the Saints treat their cheerleaders? I hope they don't use tracking chips like they do in players to record the players every move. <|endoftext|> No they have a policy where the cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as players. That would be one thing but if the cheerleader is there first and already eating they have to stop and leave if a player enters. <|endoftext|>
No they have a policy where the cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as players. That would be one thing but if the cheerleader is there first and already eating they have to stop and leave if a player enters. <|endoftext|> That's pretty insane! That is a kind of messed up, the cheerleaders are people too! Amazing how the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent the other team from reading his hand signals. The impact he had even til today! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty insane! That is a kind of messed up, the cheerleaders are people too! Amazing how the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent the other team from reading his hand signals. The impact he had even til today! <|endoftext|> That is very interesting. You would think that you would be at a disadvantage as a deaf QB. Would you think they would get more sacks? I only ask because I don't know how they would be aware of players coming in from behind them. <|endoftext|>
That is very interesting. You would think that you would be at a disadvantage as a deaf QB. Would you think they would get more sacks? I only ask because I don't know how they would be aware of players coming in from behind them. <|endoftext|> I live with someone who is hearing impaired so I might be able to answer that question, I would think that because hearing aid technology is pretty advanced these days and I'd imagine the deaf quarterback would have hearing aids on probably to prevent that or maybe the coach can intercom them through their headsets to give them a heads up? <|endoftext|>
I live with someone who is hearing impaired so I might be able to answer that question, I would think that because hearing aid technology is pretty advanced these days and I'd imagine the deaf quarterback would have hearing aids on probably to prevent that or maybe the coach can intercom them through their headsets to give them a heads up? <|endoftext|> I see. That explains a lot. Thank you for that. Have you heard of Kellan Moore? <|endoftext|>
I see. That explains a lot. Thank you for that. Have you heard of Kellan Moore? <|endoftext|> I haven't, what is he famous for? <|endoftext|>
I haven't, what is he famous for? <|endoftext|> He's a QB for Dallas. He's the only left handed QB in the NFL. <|endoftext|>
He's a QB for Dallas. He's the only left handed QB in the NFL. <|endoftext|> Oh wow! So does that put the Cowboys at an advantage or disadvantage because of that? I wonder if the plays are adjusted to accommodate that. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! So does that put the Cowboys at an advantage or disadvantage because of that? I wonder if the plays are adjusted to accommodate that. <|endoftext|> Very good questions. I've never seen a left handed QB so I'm not sure. I would be very curious to see. <|endoftext|>
Very good questions. I've never seen a left handed QB so I'm not sure. I would be very curious to see. <|endoftext|> Yeah! Because I have heard that left handed pitchers in NBL are prized possession, maybe it holds true for quarterbacks or maybe they make more than other NFL players since the average earnings of an engineer is higher than the earnings of an NFL player. <|endoftext|>
Yeah! Because I have heard that left handed pitchers in NBL are prized possession, maybe it holds true for quarterbacks or maybe they make more than other NFL players since the average earnings of an engineer is higher than the earnings of an NFL player. <|endoftext|> Given that information I would be inclined to enter engineering rather than football. It would be much easier on your body. <|endoftext|>
Given that information I would be inclined to enter engineering rather than football. It would be much easier on your body. <|endoftext|> Hello, do you like football. I love it my favorite team is the Steelers. <|endoftext|>
Hello, do you like football. I love it my favorite team is the Steelers. <|endoftext|> Cool, I do too. Don't hate me, but my favorite team is the Patriots! <|endoftext|>
Cool, I do too. Don't hate me, but my favorite team is the Patriots! <|endoftext|> No hate from over here. The Patriots are a good team. With a pretty good QB and coach. <|endoftext|>
No hate from over here. The Patriots are a good team. With a pretty good QB and coach. <|endoftext|> Thanks, I think so, too. Love me some Tom Brady! <|endoftext|>
Thanks, I think so, too. Love me some Tom Brady! <|endoftext|> Did you know in high school Bradys team didnt even score a td that year and they never put Tom on the field. <|endoftext|>
Did you know in high school Bradys team didnt even score a td that year and they never put Tom on the field. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I bet that coach regretted that decision for a long time! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I bet that coach regretted that decision for a long time! <|endoftext|> I bet he did. Did you also know that a B actually created the huddle in football. <|endoftext|>
I bet he did. Did you also know that a B actually created the huddle in football. <|endoftext|> No, I didn't know that, I thought it was a deaf quarterback that didn't want the other team to see his hand signals. <|endoftext|>
No, I didn't know that, I thought it was a deaf quarterback that didn't want the other team to see his hand signals. <|endoftext|> I dont know what happened there. I meant to say that it was deaf QB Paul D Hubbard who invented the huddle. <|endoftext|>
I dont know what happened there. I meant to say that it was deaf QB Paul D Hubbard who invented the huddle. <|endoftext|> Ok, I understand, that happens, sometimes! Your team the Steelers has a pretty good quarterback in Big Ben. <|endoftext|>
Ok, I understand, that happens, sometimes! Your team the Steelers has a pretty good quarterback in Big Ben. <|endoftext|> Yeah he is pretty good. He is getting up there in years like brady is though. <|endoftext|>
Yeah he is pretty good. He is getting up there in years like brady is though. <|endoftext|> Yeah, they both are getting old, for sure. Do you know how many left handed quarterbacks there are in the NFL? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, they both are getting old, for sure. Do you know how many left handed quarterbacks there are in the NFL? <|endoftext|> Ithink there is only one. If im not mistaken. <|endoftext|>
Ithink there is only one. If im not mistaken. <|endoftext|> Yeah, just Kellan Moore, but I would have thought there would be more than that. I'm left handed myself and I think it would be some sort of advantage, maybe? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, just Kellan Moore, but I would have thought there would be more than that. I'm left handed myself and I think it would be some sort of advantage, maybe? <|endoftext|> You would think so. Were you aware that the NFL has no rule against female players? <|endoftext|>
You would think so. Were you aware that the NFL has no rule against female players? <|endoftext|> Yes, I had read that somewhere, before. Looks like there would at least be a kicker playing, by now, it's 2019! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I had read that somewhere, before. Looks like there would at least be a kicker playing, by now, it's 2019! <|endoftext|> Well when you see how the NFL treats its cheerleaders, its no wonder why no women are playing. <|endoftext|>
Well when you see how the NFL treats its cheerleaders, its no wonder why no women are playing. <|endoftext|> That's true, I hear the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders, have it pretty bad. <|endoftext|>
That's true, I hear the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders, have it pretty bad. <|endoftext|> Yeah, they are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in. Why isnt it the other way around? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, they are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in. Why isnt it the other way around? <|endoftext|> It makes you wonder what happened that initially prompted that rule to be instituted? <|endoftext|>
It makes you wonder what happened that initially prompted that rule to be instituted? <|endoftext|> it was something. I just dont see why the cheerleaders have to be the ones to suffer. <|endoftext|>
it was something. I just dont see why the cheerleaders have to be the ones to suffer. <|endoftext|> Those evil women! it's always the women who have to suffer. <|endoftext|>
Those evil women! it's always the women who have to suffer. <|endoftext|> An NFL game only has about 11 min worth of live game play. Do you think they should do something to cut down on the time it takes to play a game. <|endoftext|>
An NFL game only has about 11 min worth of live game play. Do you think they should do something to cut down on the time it takes to play a game. <|endoftext|> Yes, I get mad when I keep hearing that stat. That last Superbowl was over three hours, with all sorts of non needed crap. Just play ball, people! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I get mad when I keep hearing that stat. That last Superbowl was over three hours, with all sorts of non needed crap. Just play ball, people! <|endoftext|> I think a lot of it is the revenue from all the ads. I'm gonna have to be getting ready for work here soon. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|>
I think a lot of it is the revenue from all the ads. I'm gonna have to be getting ready for work here soon. Nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|> Same here! Nice chatting with you, as well. Hope you enjoy your Friday! <|endoftext|>
Same here! Nice chatting with you, as well. Hope you enjoy your Friday! <|endoftext|> Hi. I was wondering if you like Football at all. <|endoftext|>
Hi. I was wondering if you like Football at all. <|endoftext|> I do, what about you? I wonder how Saquon Barkley would have done with the Browns <|endoftext|>
I do, what about you? I wonder how Saquon Barkley would have done with the Browns <|endoftext|> I love football and I do watch it all the time when the season starts. Saquon Barkley would of done some special things for the Browns if they drafted him. He is a phenomenal running back. I read somewhere that he had 51 touchdowns at Penn State the past 3 seasons. <|endoftext|>
I love football and I do watch it all the time when the season starts. Saquon Barkley would of done some special things for the Browns if they drafted him. He is a phenomenal running back. I read somewhere that he had 51 touchdowns at Penn State the past 3 seasons. <|endoftext|> He is amazing, he also had over 5000 yards from scrimmage. Who is your favorite team? <|endoftext|>
He is amazing, he also had over 5000 yards from scrimmage. Who is your favorite team? <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know this about Saquon Barkley, he is a special player. My favorite team is the New England Patriots. What is your favorite football team? <|endoftext|>
Wow I didn't know this about Saquon Barkley, he is a special player. My favorite team is the New England Patriots. What is your favorite football team? <|endoftext|> I don't really have a favorite team, I just like the NFL in general. Do you play fantasy football at all? <|endoftext|>
I don't really have a favorite team, I just like the NFL in general. Do you play fantasy football at all? <|endoftext|> I don't play fantasy football at all. Did you know that the average NFL game has just 11 minutes of gameplay? <|endoftext|>
I don't play fantasy football at all. Did you know that the average NFL game has just 11 minutes of gameplay? <|endoftext|> I would have never have guessed that. Brad Johnson is the on ly QB in history throw a TD pass to himself, but I think Mariota did that this year too though right? <|endoftext|>
I would have never have guessed that. Brad Johnson is the on ly QB in history throw a TD pass to himself, but I think Mariota did that this year too though right? <|endoftext|> I think you're correct. Did you know that Alex Smith received his Bachelor's Degree in just a couple of years? <|endoftext|>
I think you're correct. Did you know that Alex Smith received his Bachelor's Degree in just a couple of years? <|endoftext|> I did not know that, I've done this HIT so many times though I can tell you he took so many AP tests in high school he was a junior when he got to college. <|endoftext|>
I did not know that, I've done this HIT so many times though I can tell you he took so many AP tests in high school he was a junior when he got to college. <|endoftext|> That is amazing. Do you know in what year did Alex Smith became the first overall pick in the NFL draft? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. Do you know in what year did Alex Smith became the first overall pick in the NFL draft? <|endoftext|> It was 2005, he's had a good career but the 49ers should have probably of drafted Aaron Rodgers. <|endoftext|>
It was 2005, he's had a good career but the 49ers should have probably of drafted Aaron Rodgers. <|endoftext|> I agree Aaron Rogers is one the best quarterbacks in the league right now. <|endoftext|>
I agree Aaron Rogers is one the best quarterbacks in the league right now. <|endoftext|> For sure, he might be on the decline though I would suspect. After that collar bone injury I wonder if he can get back to where he was, it'd be difficult. <|endoftext|>
For sure, he might be on the decline though I would suspect. After that collar bone injury I wonder if he can get back to where he was, it'd be difficult. <|endoftext|> Oh! I felt very bad for him that injury was nasty. I hope and pray that he recovers and be able to play at the level we both know that he is capable.Do you know by any chance who did Barkley was rooting for when he was growing up? <|endoftext|>
Oh! I felt very bad for him that injury was nasty. I hope and pray that he recovers and be able to play at the level we both know that he is capable.Do you know by any chance who did Barkley was rooting for when he was growing up? <|endoftext|> Yah, he is one of the greatest, unfortunate about his injury. I'm sure he can bounce back. DeShone Kizer is going to be great too, I can just feel it. I did not know who he was rooting for, who is that? <|endoftext|>
Yah, he is one of the greatest, unfortunate about his injury. I'm sure he can bounce back. DeShone Kizer is going to be great too, I can just feel it. I did not know who he was rooting for, who is that? <|endoftext|> Saquon Barkley was rooting for the Jets when he was growing up. Kizer is another great quarterback and he will get better in time.I agree with you. <|endoftext|>
Saquon Barkley was rooting for the Jets when he was growing up. Kizer is another great quarterback and he will get better in time.I agree with you. <|endoftext|> I liked the Jets a lot when I was younger too. Except I'm about 10 years older than Saquon so he had them when they were decent, the Sanchez years. Kizer got fed to the wolves when he was in Cleveland. <|endoftext|>
I liked the Jets a lot when I was younger too. Except I'm about 10 years older than Saquon so he had them when they were decent, the Sanchez years. Kizer got fed to the wolves when he was in Cleveland. <|endoftext|> I agree Kizer didn't really have anyone to throw to in Cleveland. I don't think that Cleveland has good receivers right now. <|endoftext|>
I agree Kizer didn't really have anyone to throw to in Cleveland. I don't think that Cleveland has good receivers right now. <|endoftext|> For sure, he had terrible blocking and no offense or defense to back him up at all. Would have been a nightmare, even for Tom Brady. <|endoftext|>
For sure, he had terrible blocking and no offense or defense to back him up at all. Would have been a nightmare, even for Tom Brady. <|endoftext|> I agree. Well it was very nice chatting with you today. I hope you have a nice evening!!! Bye <|endoftext|>
I agree. Well it was very nice chatting with you today. I hope you have a nice evening!!! Bye <|endoftext|> It was great chatting with you too, hope you have a great rest of the evening. <|endoftext|>
It was great chatting with you too, hope you have a great rest of the evening. <|endoftext|> Good Evening! Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>
Good Evening! Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|> I really don't get into it. I respect the sport. I do know that the U.S. got 3rd place in the st FIFA World Cup in 1930. <|endoftext|>
I really don't get into it. I respect the sport. I do know that the U.S. got 3rd place in the st FIFA World Cup in 1930. <|endoftext|> It was all downhill from there I guess, for the men that is. The US Women have never placed below 3rd since the first cup in 1991. <|endoftext|>
It was all downhill from there I guess, for the men that is. The US Women have never placed below 3rd since the first cup in 1991. <|endoftext|> I think American Football and baseball had a lot to do with that. Hungary did pretty good in the 50's with only one defeat between 1950 and 1956. <|endoftext|>
I think American Football and baseball had a lot to do with that. Hungary did pretty good in the 50's with only one defeat between 1950 and 1956. <|endoftext|> That is pretty great. The cup has been going for a long time, only pausing for WW2 <|endoftext|>
That is pretty great. The cup has been going for a long time, only pausing for WW2 <|endoftext|> Yep. Do you watch much TV? There are plenty of choices if you're into Pokemon. There are 750+ episodes. <|endoftext|>
Yep. Do you watch much TV? There are plenty of choices if you're into Pokemon. There are 750+ episodes. <|endoftext|> That is a lot of episodes. The TV pokemon craze missed me, I was a bit too old for it when it came out first on TV. <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of episodes. The TV pokemon craze missed me, I was a bit too old for it when it came out first on TV. <|endoftext|> Yeah, only kids were into that in my case too. I wonder why the 70's Show didn't make it in the UK? It only lasted 10 episodes. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, only kids were into that in my case too. I wonder why the 70's Show didn't make it in the UK? It only lasted 10 episodes. <|endoftext|> I think it was the fact they tried to remake it verbatim, some of the humor probably didnt translate totally. <|endoftext|>
I think it was the fact they tried to remake it verbatim, some of the humor probably didnt translate totally. <|endoftext|> Makes sense... Maybe the Simpsons works there? There is only one Simpsons episode where Bart isn't mentioned or appears? It's OK with me because I like Homer the best. <|endoftext|>
Makes sense... Maybe the Simpsons works there? There is only one Simpsons episode where Bart isn't mentioned or appears? It's OK with me because I like Homer the best. <|endoftext|> Ahh Homer. I heard he had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes. <|endoftext|>
Ahh Homer. I heard he had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes. <|endoftext|> He seems to be a hard workin' man... Do you watch the NFL? According to the stats, there is actually only 11 minutes of actual playtime in an average NFL game. It takes 3+ hours for that? <|endoftext|>
He seems to be a hard workin' man... Do you watch the NFL? According to the stats, there is actually only 11 minutes of actual playtime in an average NFL game. It takes 3+ hours for that? <|endoftext|> I know, and that isnt even a consecutive 11 minutes. Maybe females in the league would change that up. <|endoftext|>
I know, and that isnt even a consecutive 11 minutes. Maybe females in the league would change that up. <|endoftext|> I played in HS, it seemed longer than that. Yeah, maybe, the NFL has no written rule for women to play. Why not? <|endoftext|>
I played in HS, it seemed longer than that. Yeah, maybe, the NFL has no written rule for women to play. Why not? <|endoftext|> Maybe it is how the Saints' treat their cheerleaders? Or getting crushed by a 300 pound linebacker. Both sound like good deterrents to me. <|endoftext|>

What I can tell also, meaning grow up! He seems to use it alot in this article.

I too think solar could have a major role. But, we really need to advance our ability and knowledge in large scale energy storage.

On November 13th of this past year, they were mourning and Trump started to attack the French President Emmanuel Macron... did you know about this? <|endoftext|> Well, when the twitter in chief starts, I usually assume he is misinformed. France seems to have done little to cause Trumps twitter attack. <|endoftext|>
Well, when the twitter in chief starts, I usually assume he is misinformed. France seems to have done little to cause Trumps twitter attack. <|endoftext|> Yeah agreed. For some reason he decided to ridicule France about their performance in WWI and WWII... and accused Macron of forming a European army to attack the US... <|endoftext|>
Yeah agreed. For some reason he decided to ridicule France about their performance in WWI and WWII... and accused Macron of forming a European army to attack the US... <|endoftext|> I think Trump had, some time ago, criticized NATO and how much the US pays into NATO. Here is a member nation saying they need a bigger role. The guy makes no sense at times. <|endoftext|>
I think Trump had, some time ago, criticized NATO and how much the US pays into NATO. Here is a member nation saying they need a bigger role. The guy makes no sense at times. <|endoftext|> Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. Macron was actually kind of agreeing with Trump in that Europe should garner greater defense capabilities to take some of the burden of the US! <|endoftext|>
Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. Macron was actually kind of agreeing with Trump in that Europe should garner greater defense capabilities to take some of the burden of the US! <|endoftext|> Trump was correct in saying that Macron has low approval ratings. I believe the yellow vest riots happened soon after. But Trumps timing and tone was... un presidential. <|endoftext|>
Trump was correct in saying that Macron has low approval ratings. I believe the yellow vest riots happened soon after. But Trumps timing and tone was... un presidential. <|endoftext|> Very unpresidential. Trump's approval rating isn't great either, though not as bad as 26%! <|endoftext|>
Very unpresidential. Trump's approval rating isn't great either, though not as bad as 26%! <|endoftext|> The last president to speak a foreign language fluently was FDR. It would be funny to have a law where every candidate had to be fluent in one other language. <|endoftext|>
The last president to speak a foreign language fluently was FDR. It would be funny to have a law where every candidate had to be fluent in one other language. <|endoftext|> That would be so interesting. I wonder if Trump would choose German to support his fanbase... just kidding haha. <|endoftext|>
That would be so interesting. I wonder if Trump would choose German to support his fanbase... just kidding haha. <|endoftext|> Oh, I don't know. It would make for smarter candidates. And the candidates would know more about the world in general. More presidential candidates. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I don't know. It would make for smarter candidates. And the candidates would know more about the world in general. More presidential candidates. <|endoftext|> I agree wholeheartedly. I think the only way to be an effective leader of a country in today's globalism is to be knowledgeable of other countries and to be able to effectively communicate with them, and what better way to do that than through actually learning their means of communicating? <|endoftext|>

Instead we have titter wars started for small reasons. It does entertain the voters however. <|endoftext|>
Right on. Instead we have titter wars started for small reasons. It does entertain the voters however. <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's unfortunate that voters are so easily swayed by what entertains them.

Yeah, it's unfortunate that voters are so easily swayed by what entertains them.

And if you think that's a lot of concerts, you'd be surprised to find out that the Ramones played 2,263 concerts over the course of 20 years, basically non-stop! <|endoftext|>

Yeah. I didn't know cars caught on faster in the US than in other parts of the world. <|endoftext|> I was going to mention that too.

I was going to mention that too. Karl Benz patented them first, but Ford was widely accepted much more quickly. Goes to show how important the inventions of interchangeable parts and assembly lines were. <|endoftext|> Yes, exactly. I guess that was Benz of Mercedes-Benz? <|endoftext|>

Do you think the seller was unwell just like that woman who ran over another driver because she wanted to make a car payment? <|endoftext|> I think she just snapped. It happens.

I think she just snapped. It happens. Mine would be from not realizing there was an icon on next to the pump symbol, that tells which side your gas tank is on. <|endoftext|> You would not snap like that woman though. Which country created the first car? Was it US or Germany? <|endoftext|>

Hey there. I heard that Laura Ingraham is being sued. Did you hear that yet? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I heard that Laura was very demanding and when her assistant got pregnant she was fired. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I heard that Laura was very demanding and when her assistant got pregnant she was fired. <|endoftext|> Exactly! I guess that the assistant was having her first child which is also a factor in the lawsuit. I guess the poor girl had to work 7 days a week most of the time. <|endoftext|>
Exactly! I guess that the assistant was having her first child which is also a factor in the lawsuit.

Yes, this does seem like a good case of pregnancy discrimination under FMLA and her district's Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. <|endoftext|> Yes, it sounds legit to me too.

Yes, it sounds legit to me too. Karolina Wilson stated that Laura Ingraham was not easily satisfied but that she was always happy with Ms. Wilson's work. <|endoftext|> But Ingraham did let Wilson stay with the company for three weeks so she could get unemployment insurance. Hopefully this isn't just a case of a disgruntled worker who happened to be pregnant. What do you think? <|endoftext|>
But Ingraham did let Wilson stay with the company for three weeks so she could get unemployment insurance. Hopefully this isn't just a case of a disgruntled worker who happened to be pregnant.

Hmm? That is a valid point. The report states that Ms. Wilson was also angry about the inability to have a private area to pump breast milk for her child. <|endoftext|> The company denies that Wilson was ever an efficient worker. <|endoftext|>
The company denies that Wilson was ever an efficient worker. <|endoftext|> Oh, that changes things for sure. I am not sure that I see Laura Ingraham keeping an assistant more than a day whom she was not happy with. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that changes things for sure. I am not sure that I see Laura Ingraham keeping an assistant more than a day whom she was not happy with. <|endoftext|> That is true. It's tricky because it seems it's mostly one person's word against another. <|endoftext|>
That is true. It's tricky because it seems it's mostly one person's word against another. <|endoftext|> Yes, I totally agree! Laura Ingraham's company has less than 20 employees so I think the law changes for smaller companies also. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I totally agree! Laura Ingraham's company has less than 20 employees so I think the law changes for smaller companies also. <|endoftext|> Apparently Ingraham gave Wilson assignments on the day she was going into labor. There may be proof in text. <|endoftext|>
Apparently Ingraham gave Wilson assignments on the day she was going into labor. There may be proof in text. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree! <|endoftext|>

But who knows, maybe her replacement is actually a better worker. <|endoftext|> Yeah, that is America. We support fairness!

HA! That is pretty true! Great point! All those hamburgers did not help obesity. <|endoftext|> Yeah, maybe we have to go back to the time before cars. It's surprising to believe that cars were just available to the masses only a little over a century ago. Before that most people walked and took animal drawn carriages and carts. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, maybe we have to go back to the time before cars. It's surprising to believe that cars were just available to the masses only a little over a century ago.

Well, it is almost like rotary phones that dialed 212 area code the fastest. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is amazing! Well, it is almost like rotary phones that dialed 212 area code the fastest. <|endoftext|> I had one of those when I was little. I think it was after its time but my parents were too cheap to replace it. <|endoftext|>

right! What do you think about the new orleans cheerleaders not being aboe to eat at the same restaurant as the football players? <|endoftext|> I think it is ridiculous.

I think it is ridiculous. I mean they even have to leave if they are already there. No wonder there are no women players. They dont treat women very well. <|endoftext|> Yeah thats really rude.

Yeah thats really rude. If that is the rule the players should have to submit a itinerary of where they are eating so the cheerleader wont have to randomly leave a restaurant in the mid of their meal. <|endoftext|> Agreed.

Agreed. I wonder if that is just like during the season, training, or anytime. What could possibly have happened to make a rule like that, <|endoftext|> Maybe some kind of fratenization issue. I have no clue. <|endoftext|>

it would be a little scary to me lol most baseball managers are older, and usually dont warm up with the team, they might get injured lol <|endoftext|> I think watching all the managers play each other might be cool. Proper warm up is definitely important. Dont want any injuries. <|endoftext|>

Hey there do you ever watch the NFL on TV? I know that I watch the Super Bowl <|endoftext|> I missed the Superbowl this year, but judging from the score didn't seem to be an outstandingly played game. But still must be an improvement over the first playoffs in 1932. <|endoftext|>
I missed the Superbowl this year, but judging from the score didn't seem to be an outstandingly played game. But still must be an improvement over the first playoffs in 1932. <|endoftext|> Yep I would imagine it was a lot more exciting than that game haha. But yes you're right, the Super Bowl is a little bit boring, but then again the average NFL game only has about 10 minutes of actual gameplay <|endoftext|>
Yep I would imagine it was a lot more exciting than that game haha. But yes you're right, the Super Bowl is a little bit boring, but then again the average NFL game only has about 10 minutes of actual gameplay <|endoftext|> Crazy for a game that has a clock time of 1 hour and takes like 4 hours to play. Lol <|endoftext|>
Crazy for a game that has a clock time of 1 hour and takes like 4 hours to play. Lol <|endoftext|> LOL you're right about that haha. Another crazy thing is the way the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are treated. I don't think it's right that they have to leave a restaurant if a player is already inside <|endoftext|>
LOL you're right about that haha. Another crazy thing is the way the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are treated. I don't think it's right that they have to leave a restaurant if a player is already inside <|endoftext|> Or even worse, I heard they have to leave if one enters a restaurant they are already in. Who would agree to something like that. <|endoftext|>
Or even worse, I heard they have to leave if one enters a restaurant they are already in. Who would agree to something like that. <|endoftext|> I know right? I wonder if that's for all cheerleading teams or if that is specific to the Saints? Do you know anything more about that? I do know that technically females could play for the NFL, maybe one day all of the cheerleaders will be men and all of the players will be female haha <|endoftext|>

I know someone who cheered on the Bucs squad and she never said anything of that nature, so it might just be the saints. If the roles were reversed, the game would likely be more efficient, I doubt women would go for the long games, with little play. <|endoftext|> Yeah I just don't know. I could see it happening though. But one thing that is for sure is that an engineer will earn more than either in NFL or MLB player over their lifetime which I think is kind of wild <|endoftext|>
Yeah I just don't know. I could see it happening though. But one thing that is for sure is that an engineer will earn more than either in NFL or MLB player over their lifetime which I think is kind of wild <|endoftext|> It is, but when you break it down, the engineer can work a lot longer than the athletes, thus has more years of earning potential. There is one rocket scientist coach in the NFL, his college fight song was crazy, including 6 digits of Pi. <|endoftext|>

Wasn't it due to a deaf quarterback not wanting the opposing team to be able to read his hand signals? <|endoftext|> Yep you're 100% right. The quarterback's name was Paul D Hubbard.

Yep you're 100% right. The quarterback's name was Paul D Hubbard.

It is one of the few sports I couldn't get into. Id play for fun, in pick up games, but watching it is kind of dull.

Yep I agree with you. One thing is that in Canada they don't call kickball kickball. They call it soccer-baseball. that sounds really stupid to me haha <|endoftext|> It kinda sounds like a name you give something to somehow make it more legitimate.

I think he might surprise some people, he might not have a good track record lately but who knows, what are your thoughts on the matter? <|endoftext|> I think he is a really hard worker and is dedicated to the game. He works harder than everyone else on the field. <|endoftext|>
I think he is a really hard worker and is dedicated to the game. He works harder than everyone else on the field. <|endoftext|> Exactly, he might not be the most taleneted player but hard work can pay off, it seems like Mike Francesa really has something against him. <|endoftext|>
Exactly, he might not be the most taleneted player but hard work can pay off, it seems like Mike Francesa really has something against him. <|endoftext|> I agree. With the NFL consisting of 32 teams I don't see why he has to pick on Tebow. <|endoftext|>

I wonder why more women don't play? and why there arent more left handed QB's in addition to kellan moore. <|endoftext|> Maybe because of the risk of the game- I certainly wouldn't want to try it. And that's news to me, I thought there were at least a couple more <|endoftext|>

Yeah, is it the NFL or the teams themselves? What would the NFL themselves use it for? <|endoftext|> I think it's the NFL, probably most likely to track the players to see if they sustain concussions, most likely.

I agree. Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|> I do, interesting how the radio works, it carries waves in form of information, it looks simple but theres a lot of science behind the inventiion <|endoftext|>

That must be amazing, a bit boring after a while but I like astonomy <|endoftext|> I bet it's very boring lol. In Canada, all radios must play at least 40% of the music from Canada. <|endoftext|>

Good morning. <|endoftext|> Good morning. Do you trust the government? <|endoftext|>
Good morning. Do you trust the government? <|endoftext|> Wow, that is a very interesting question. In general, it is hard to trust them all of the time, but I do find the history of our government quire interesting. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a very interesting question. In general, it is hard to trust them all of the time, but I do find the history of our government quire interesting. <|endoftext|> I believe having a more malleable government, responsive to the people would be better.

I believe having a more malleable government, responsive to the people would be better. Do you know if the US government was more responsive in the past? <|endoftext|> Maybe when we were a smaller country. It is hard when the US has gotten so large to respond to everyone.

If texas wants open carry of automatic weapons, and Massachusetts wants to try single-payer healthcare, then let them, and let people come and go.

Why should "absolute state authority" be of importance? Like a dictatorship? <|endoftext|> Well, the government does have laws and policies to enforce which is important.

Like the Queen? Do you think a ceremonial purpose is a good reason to have a high-profile, highly-paid government official? <|endoftext|> Maybe, maybe not.

I don't, do you? He just threw NATO into chaos too. <|endoftext|> Yes I do like him. But that's probably a subject we would never agree on. Did you know that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana? <|endoftext|>
Yes I do like him. But that's probably a subject we would never agree on.

I guess it was FDR, I would think there was more than just one. I think it should something all presidents should be able to do. <|endoftext|> Agreed. I would think being able to talk to others in their language would be helpful. At least they are not called president banana! <|endoftext|>
Agreed. I would think being able to talk to others in their language would be helpful. At least they are not called president banana! <|endoftext|> Yeah isn't that funny! I think it was because his name was really close to that. <|endoftext|>

Hey that is a good call, he sure does seem unique! And that is pretty wild, I wonder what the guests that come to stay think. <|endoftext|> I wonder if he will ever make a pop album? <|endoftext|>
I wonder if he will ever make a pop album? <|endoftext|> I would be pretty upset if my president had enough time to make 3 albums while in charge of the country. <|endoftext|>
I would be pretty upset if my president had enough time to make 3 albums while in charge of the country. <|endoftext|> Me too! Plus, who wants to hear their president sing? Did you see where in 1805 the runner up was the VP? <|endoftext|>
Me too! Plus, who wants to hear their president sing? Did you see where in 1805 the runner up was the VP? <|endoftext|> Agreed, and yeah wouldn't that be something if we went back to that system. Talk about a reality show. <|endoftext|>
Agreed, and yeah wouldn't that be something if we went back to that system. Talk about a reality show. <|endoftext|> I am not sure if we would be able to function as a government in today's society with Trump and Hilary, but it's worth giving them a chance. <|endoftext|>
I am not sure if we would be able to function as a government in today's society with Trump and Hilary, but it's worth giving them a chance. <|endoftext|> Yeah I think I would agree, but who knows, maybe it would work better than what we have now. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I think I would agree, but who knows, maybe it would work better than what we have now. <|endoftext|> Do you listen to the radio? There is a website where you can listen to old classic radio... kind of cool. <|endoftext|>

Probably not as much as I should. Did you know there was only one U.S. President with a Phd? <|endoftext|> Sounds about right. I figure most of them don't really like school much. The last president to speak a foreign language was FDR. <|endoftext|>
Sounds about right. I figure most of them don't really like school much. The last president to speak a foreign language was FDR. <|endoftext|> That is interesting. Do you think it odd that while many countries use the term president, the role of the president is different? <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. Do you think it odd that while many countries use the term president, the role of the president is different? <|endoftext|> I believe that.

Well that is interesting. I had no idea. Maybe we could all have bigger houses if the U.S. government did away with income tax like Monaco. <|endoftext|> I wonder where Monaco gets money for the government then.

He could rent out the guest house. Put up a TRUMP sign. Make enough money to become the wealthiest. <|endoftext|> It could be the new Trump hotel. Staying in the guest house would be a cool experience. Maybe they should sell nights to pay down the national debt. <|endoftext|>

Do you follow what is happening in Colombia ? <|endoftext|> I have a little bit. The problem in South America is that all these socialist countries are realizing too late that socialism is a terrible way to govern! <|endoftext|>
I have a little bit. The problem in South America is that all these socialist countries are realizing too late that socialism is a terrible way to govern! <|endoftext|> On how is socialism related to the peace accord with the FARC ? <|endoftext|>
On how is socialism related to the peace accord with the FARC ? <|endoftext|> A lot of Colombian government is rooted in the communist uprising that occurred about 30 or 40 years ago. So now they want a right wing candidate, Duque. But unfortunately, his only experience is as a one term senator. <|endoftext|>
A lot of Colombian government is rooted in the communist uprising that occurred about 30 or 40 years ago. So now they want a right wing candidate, Duque.

But reversing Santo's peace accord would mean war again with FARC, is it worth it ? <|endoftext|> Probably not. I love the freedom we have in the United States especially when you look at China and realize that the word censorship is actually censored! <|endoftext|>
Probably not. I love the freedom we have in the United States especially when you look at China and realize that the word censorship is actually censored! <|endoftext|> Yeah, China's censorship is problematic, before internet, western world used radio programs to send uncensored news to the communist countries. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, China's censorship is problematic, before internet, western world used radio programs to send uncensored news to the communist countries. <|endoftext|> Yes, the radio used to be such a useful communication device, especially for entertainment.

I do for sports talk now. It is very interesting to me that a radio station translates solar activity into sound and anyone can listen to the "music of the sun." <|endoftext|> Or you could listen to a radio storm on Jupiter.

He was good or maybe he paid radios to play his music, I suspect the president of Indonesia to do the same thing with his 3 pop music albums. <|endoftext|> That is wild! What do you make of all the government shutdown news? They make such a big deal about it, but its actually happened 17 times in the last 37 years. <|endoftext|>
That is wild! What do you make of all the government shutdown news?

It think it is part of the media circus of our time, politicians like the drama more than an efficient government. <|endoftext|> Haha, totally. We just have career politicians now, with the exception of Trump. In fact, only one US president has ever had a PhD! <|endoftext|>
Haha, totally. We just have career politicians now, with the exception of Trump. In fact, only one US president has ever had a PhD! <|endoftext|> And who was it ? I am always surprised by presidents, like Washington being of the richest presidents. <|endoftext|>
And who was it ? I am always surprised by presidents, like Washington being of the richest presidents. <|endoftext|> Yea, has to be adjusted for inflation I think. Woodrow Wilson is the only president with the PhD. <|endoftext|>
Yea, has to be adjusted for inflation I think. Woodrow Wilson is the only president with the PhD. <|endoftext|> I hope it was adjusted for inflation, otherwise Washington would have been richer that the King of England. <|endoftext|>
I hope it was adjusted for inflation, otherwise Washington would have been richer that the King of England. <|endoftext|> Haha, good point! Speaking of rich governments, Monaco was able to get rid of their income tax all the way back in 1869 because the casino was generating so much revenue. <|endoftext|>
Haha, good point! Speaking of rich governments, Monaco was able to get rid of their income tax all the way back in 1869 because the casino was generating so much revenue. <|endoftext|> And Norway, who is also rich because of its oil, donated 1 billion to save the rain forest.

Did you know that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I guess that didn't work out so well. <|endoftext|> Wow, didn't know that. Talk about spoiler alert. I heard a guy in France illegally sold the Eiffel Tower not just once, but twice. <|endoftext|>
Wow, didn't know that. Talk about spoiler alert. I heard a guy in France illegally sold the Eiffel Tower not just once, but twice. <|endoftext|> I wonder who was dumb enough to buy it? It would have been funnier if it was the same person both times. <|endoftext|>
I wonder who was dumb enough to buy it? It would have been funnier if it was the same person both times. <|endoftext|> Yes, absolutely! Ha! Not only that but how come nobody in the French government noticed the impersonator? Maybe he was some sort of look-alike. Not to change countries, but did you hear that 86% of Nevada is owned by the U.S. Government? That's sounds a little scary. What do they have stored there? <|endoftext|>

I know there's a few military bases there, and area 51 is there I believe too. So there's probably a lot of missle test sites out in the desert there. So that might equate into some of that percentage. <|endoftext|>

No doubt in my mind! Still, it sounds like a secret they don't want us to find out. That's just another example of the balance between the idea of government authority and the principle of our individual freedom. <|endoftext|> That is true.

That is true. They're always seem to be up to shady stuff, just like in 2006 they passed legislation that would protect Government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Conventions. <|endoftext|> Yes, that does sound shady to me as well.

Yes, that does sound shady to me as well. Geneva conventions are international law.

I guess so, why can't our government do good like the Norwegian government? In 2008 they donated $1bn to help save the Amazon rain forest! <|endoftext|> I know, right? How cool was that?

Our government waste money on things like making the president's guest house bigger than the White House! <|endoftext|> Yes, that's all sorts of crazy, they should be spending money on things that make a difference like renovating the rain forest to make our planet more stable.

I agree, maybe we should have a president that releases pop albums like Indonesia's president has. He's released 3 while in office. Could you imagine if one of our past few presidents released an album? <|endoftext|> Hey, that would be awesome if Trump would release a Mexican salsa dancing album where he dances and sings. That would go viral in an instant on YouTube. That would be a blast. The radio stations would pick it up and carry the sound through space and when the radio waves hit an electrical conductor, it would be transformed back to the original. How cool would that be? I'd watch it. <|endoftext|>

I'd watch it. <|endoftext|> That would be pretty epic. Did you know that up until 1805 in the U.S. that the runner up in the presidential election automatically became the Vice President? Could you imagine that happening today? I think it would force both parties to work together more. <|endoftext|>

It was JFK, Washington and Jefferson right? I wonder how Washington and Jefferson had so much money? <|endoftext|> Yes it was probably from slavery actually.

Yes, I have been to Indonesia. I hear he doesn't only do his presidential duties though, he also is a musician? <|endoftext|> Yes that's what I heard too. He released three pop albums. I wonder how good they were? Will you listen to them LOL? <|endoftext|>
Yes that's what I heard too. He released three pop albums. I wonder how good they were? Will you listen to them LOL? <|endoftext|> Haha, I probably will not listen to them. Well maybe out of curiosity. Do you think the runner up of an election should be vice president? I think they do that in Indonesia. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I probably will not listen to them. Well maybe out of curiosity. Do you think the runner up of an election should be vice president? I think they do that in Indonesia. <|endoftext|> So interesting. I don't, I think that would have been a disaster with Vice President Clinton and President Trump LOL. I can only see bad things happening from that, I'm glad that they changed that real back in 1805, what about you? <|endoftext|>
So interesting. I don't, I think that would have been a disaster with Vice President Clinton and President Trump LOL. I can only see bad things happening from that, I'm glad that they changed that real back in 1805, what about you? <|endoftext|> Haha, I think it would be interesting but probably not the best idea. I thought Trump was one of the richest presidents but maybe not. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I think it would be interesting but probably not the best idea. I thought Trump was one of the richest presidents but maybe not. <|endoftext|> Yeah I thought that too. It's shocking that it's actually JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. You would think that Trump would be up there, I wonder if this is adjusted for inflation? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I thought that too. It's shocking that it's actually JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. You would think that Trump would be up there, I wonder if this is adjusted for inflation? <|endoftext|> Right, I bet it did adjust for inflation. Maybe the list is outdated too. Do you follow Trump on Twitter? <|endoftext|>
Right, I bet it did adjust for inflation. Maybe the list is outdated too. Do you follow Trump on Twitter? <|endoftext|> No I don't follow him on twitter. I don't use Twitter personally haha. What about you? I also have a Facebook account I don't use that either haha <|endoftext|>
No I don't follow him on twitter. I don't use Twitter personally haha. What about you? I also have a Facebook account I don't use that either haha <|endoftext|> Yeah I use Facebook a little but try not to as much. It's cool that Iceland is rewriting their constitution via Facebook. Maybe I would use it more if we did something like that. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I use Facebook a little but try not to as much. It's cool that Iceland is rewriting their constitution via Facebook. Maybe I would use it more if we did something like that. <|endoftext|> That is interesting. I wonder how they prevent just anyone from making bad editions though haha. Did you ever do the Facebook Burger King campaign? <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. I wonder how they prevent just anyone from making bad editions though haha. Did you ever do the Facebook Burger King campaign? <|endoftext|> Which campaign is that? I don't believe so. <|endoftext|>
Which campaign is that? I don't believe so. <|endoftext|> It's the one where you unfriend 10 people and in return Burger King gets you a free Whopper LOL. Apparently the person that you unfriend also gets a message, they would get sent that you valued their friendship at 1/10 the value of a whopper lol <|endoftext|>
It's the one where you unfriend 10 people and in return Burger King gets you a free Whopper LOL. Apparently the person that you unfriend also gets a message, they would get sent that you valued their friendship at 1/10 the value of a whopper lol <|endoftext|> Ha! Well that would be useful for me. Maybe we need to ban Facebook. Facebook's like button is illegal in Sclewig-Holstein. <|endoftext|>
Ha! Well that would be useful for me. Maybe we need to ban Facebook. Facebook's like button is illegal in Sclewig-Holstein. <|endoftext|> That is interesting. I wonder why they banned it. Can you believe that Myspace turn down an offer to buy Facebook, only seventy-five million seems like a bargain today, but how would you know that back in the day <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. I wonder why they banned it. Can you believe that Myspace turn down an offer to buy Facebook, only seventy-five million seems like a bargain today, but how would you know that back in the day <|endoftext|> Wow, bet they are regretting that now! I was hesitant to move to Facebook from Myspace because I thought it was boring, such a lack of color. <|endoftext|>
Wow, bet they are regretting that now! I was hesitant to move to Facebook from Myspace because I thought it was boring, such a lack of color. <|endoftext|> Haha that's a good point. What's weird is that Facebook is blue for a reason. It's because Mark Zuckerberg is actually colorblind, and so he can't really distinguish between the colors red or green <|endoftext|>
Haha that's a good point. What's weird is that Facebook is blue for a reason. It's because Mark Zuckerberg is actually colorblind, and so he can't really distinguish between the colors red or green <|endoftext|> Oh, well that makes a lot more sense. Sometimes I wish we could go back to the simple days of listening to the radio. I'd like to learn how to make a foxhole radio like WWII soldiers did. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that makes a lot more sense. Sometimes I wish we could go back to the simple days of listening to the radio. I'd like to learn how to make a foxhole radio like WWII soldiers did. <|endoftext|> Yeah I wish I knew how to do that. It would be useful to make a radio out of a pencil and a razor blade haha I don't even know how that's possible, they sure were talented back then <|endoftext|>
Yeah I wish I knew how to do that. It would be useful to make a radio out of a pencil and a razor blade haha I don't even know how that's possible, they sure were talented back then <|endoftext|> Hi! Did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe, was called "President Banana"? <|endoftext|>

Funny, I wonder how he/she got that name? Did you know there is missing journalist in Turkey? <|endoftext|> I did not. Do you know why? <|endoftext|>
I did not. Do you know why? <|endoftext|> Turkey is not fond of journalists from other countries. But I don't know the details. There are attacks going on over there from France and other hostilities. <|endoftext|>
Turkey is not fond of journalists from other countries. But I don't know the details. There are attacks going on over there from France and other hostilities. <|endoftext|> Well, France did enact a law for catcalling. Maybe with having to hand over the money immediately, will curb some of that aggressive behavior. <|endoftext|>
Well, France did enact a law for catcalling. Maybe with having to hand over the money immediately, will curb some of that aggressive behavior. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a fair law to me. The video of a guy attacking a woman in Paris went viral. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a fair law to me. The video of a guy attacking a woman in Paris went viral. <|endoftext|> He threw an ashtray at her, and punched her in the face. He deserves to rot in jail. <|endoftext|>
He threw an ashtray at her, and punched her in the face. He deserves to rot in jail. <|endoftext|> Yes. It seems like there is violence everywhere. Guatemala is no exception... The police surrounded an MS-13 gang leader named Cabrera and he shot himself. <|endoftext|>
Yes. It seems like there is violence everywhere. Guatemala is no exception... The police surrounded an MS-13 gang leader named Cabrera and he shot himself. <|endoftext|> That's one way to keep from going to jail. It's interesting that trump isn't among the wealthiest presidents. Even JFK is richer than he. <|endoftext|>
That's one way to keep from going to jail. It's interesting that trump isn't among the wealthiest presidents. Even JFK is richer than he. <|endoftext|> I'm wondering if that is correct. I think his dad was rich (Joe Kennedy) but not JFK. His dad became rich bootlegging booze during prohibition. I can't believe the press glamorizes the Kennedy's. <|endoftext|>
I'm wondering if that is correct. I think his dad was rich (Joe Kennedy) but not JFK. His dad became rich bootlegging booze during prohibition. I can't believe the press glamorizes the Kennedy's. <|endoftext|> His dad did more than that, and so have the Kennedy family. They are worthy of the praise. Washington is richer than he is though. <|endoftext|>
His dad did more than that, and so have the Kennedy family. They are worthy of the praise. Washington is richer than he is though. <|endoftext|> Worthy of the praise? Maybe our leaders should play more music. The press of Indonesia has 3 pop albums. <|endoftext|>

I do not, as it is overrun with conspiracy theorists. I deleted my account during the Burger King promotion. <|endoftext|> The fact that Ted's date drown and he did nothing but CYA is not a theory. Iceland uses Facebook for rewriting their constitution. Pretty clever... <|endoftext|>
The fact that Ted's date drown and he did nothing but CYA is not a theory. Iceland uses Facebook for rewriting their constitution. Pretty clever... <|endoftext|> lol. Exactly why I avoid Facebook.

Me, neither. Still, this should not be a reason to tolerate such behavior. Considering that the Post has been one of the leaders in exposing it <|endoftext|> Yeah, exactly. Any other workplace, and the offender would be out of a job instantly. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, exactly. Any other workplace, and the offender would be out of a job instantly. <|endoftext|> Yes, that's my train of thought. Reserving such a special treatment for him only diminishes the value of future articles on the subject. <|endoftext|>
Yes, that's my train of thought. Reserving such a special treatment for him only diminishes the value of future articles on the subject. <|endoftext|> It absolutely does. It's hard to condemn something if they don't do the right thing when it happens in their house. <|endoftext|>
It absolutely does. It's hard to condemn something if they don't do the right thing when it happens in their house. <|endoftext|> Yes, same thing that the Times did with their reporter. Netflix at least removed Kevin Spacey right away from their shows. That's a company doing it the right way <|endoftext|>
Yes, same thing that the Times did with their reporter. Netflix at least removed Kevin Spacey right away from their shows. That's a company doing it the right way <|endoftext|> Yeah, and they even did another season of his show without him, to wrap it up for the viewers. That's a lot better than just dropping it and acting like it never happened. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, and they even did another season of his show without him, to wrap it up for the viewers. That's a lot better than just dropping it and acting like it never happened. <|endoftext|> Yeah, you got give Netflix the props deserved for such action. This actions by the news papers show a lack of morality. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, you got give Netflix the props deserved for such action. This actions by the news papers show a lack of morality. <|endoftext|> Not to mention integrity. If a punishment is good for one offender, it has to be good for all offenders. Regardless of their talents. <|endoftext|>
Not to mention integrity. If a punishment is good for one offender, it has to be good for all offenders. Regardless of their talents. <|endoftext|> Yes, absolutely correct. It is mentioned in that the Post is considering termination as well. This is all based on verbal misconduct not physical. Maybe that's why the leniency <|endoftext|>
Yes, absolutely correct. It is mentioned in that the Post is considering termination as well. This is all based on verbal misconduct not physical.

That's a good point. There's a big difference between verbal and physical. It's kinda hard to judge without knowing the details. <|endoftext|> Yes, it does make it difficult.

Yes, it does make it difficult. It is a difficult topic since it is getting harder and harder to figure out what is appropriate behavior. And most of this people that are accused are used to a different work culture <|endoftext|> That's the biggest thing, I think. A lot of things that might have been harmless jokes in the past are considered serious offenses by some people now. It's all about knowing the people around you, I suppose. <|endoftext|>
That's the biggest thing, I think. A lot of things that might have been harmless jokes in the past are considered serious offenses by some people now. It's all about knowing the people around you, I suppose. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I agree. The present workplace has become very conscious and delicate.

Yeah, I agree. The present workplace has become very conscious and delicate. Like did you read the fact how soldiers used to make radios in WW2.

Yeah, things have definitely become more simple. I wouldn't know where to start making a radio if I just had a razorblade and pencil on hand. <|endoftext|> Haha, me neither.

Haha, me neither. We have become spoiled by technology. That is curios though to see how they actually made the radio, and what quality it had <|endoftext|> It definitely is. I imagine the quality wasn't great, but it's pretty amazing if it even worked. <|endoftext|>
It definitely is. I imagine the quality wasn't great, but it's pretty amazing if it even worked. <|endoftext|> Yes, and I like the name foxhole radios. Now we can stream High definition images on our cellphones. Entertainment has definitely changed as well <|endoftext|>

Your right, I agree! No written rule at all. An engineer in his lifetime will make more than the lifetime of a nfl player. <|endoftext|> Yeah that's surprising! I thought they make a lot more.

Lol...there is also tracking chips in the footballs to track ball speed, rotation, velocity and location. <|endoftext|> Maybe they could spend some more funding on making the game more lively. there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game.

Maybe they could spend some more funding on making the game more lively. there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game.

Yeah, I agree. He can throw bullets with great accuracy too. Perry has the Southern Methodist game haunting him and has something to prove now. <|endoftext|> I don't blame him. He rushed 282 yards which was a record but his only pass was intercepted. Definitely impacted his confidence in what he could do and his abilities. <|endoftext|>
I don't blame him. He rushed 282 yards which was a record but his only pass was intercepted.

You make a really good point that I forgot to credit him. The offensive coordinator Ivan Jasper has been working with Perry on throwing and new reps. <|endoftext|> They feel really confident about Perry's skills as a thrower.

They feel really confident about Perry's skills as a thrower. Though it's been a few years since Perry focused on passing, he was a quarterback in high school. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I agree with you.

Yeah, I agree with you. Coach Jasper has also been working with Perry on rapid-fire passing drills and throwing one-on-one with him since spring practice. That is promising and super cool too. <|endoftext|> I agree. I think Jasper is in a better more focused place to work with Perry too.

I agree. I think Jasper is in a better more focused place to work with Perry too. He's been more focused and in a better place to be able to work with Perry since his son's heart transplant surgery. <|endoftext|> I can't even imagine going through something so scary and serious with any of my kids. Perry has a good handle of his career and his personal life and knows how to focus on what's important and be in the moment. Alex Smith is another amazing QB. <|endoftext|>
I can't even imagine going through something so scary and serious with any of my kids.

Perry seems more mature and comfortable in the football world too. It seems like he understands things better and is in a position to answer questions and talk in football speak. <|endoftext|> Yeah, he might be the next Alex Smith or Baker Mayfield?

Yeah, he might be the next Alex Smith or Baker Mayfield? Who knows because both of those quarterbacks are very accomplished. Alex Smith went to college early.

Random fact though, did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in the NFL? <|endoftext|>
Really? That's impressive. I did not know that about Alex Smith. Random fact though, did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in the NFL? <|endoftext|> Noway, I have never really thought about it but that is very rare.

Noway, I have never really thought about it but that is very rare. Yeah Alex Smith was actually getting his bachelors within the first two years of college.

Wow that's really cool. Sounds a lot like that senior Abey. Started 9 games last year for a 7-6 team. <|endoftext|> Man, thats crazy,really? I went to Kansas and James Naismith was the inventor of the basketball, that's the closest I have been to a famous college story. <|endoftext|>
Man, thats crazy,really? I went to Kansas and James Naismith was the inventor of the basketball, that's the closest I have been to a famous college story. <|endoftext|> Well that's super cool!

Well that's super cool! Another random fact which surprised me the other day, only 2 African American quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. <|endoftext|> Noway, that doesn't seem right but it is a fact for sure. The highest paid state employees are coaches now thats not surprising. <|endoftext|>
Noway, that doesn't seem right but it is a fact for sure. The highest paid state employees are coaches now thats not surprising. <|endoftext|> I did not know that about coaches though I guess it makes sense. I do know that the american flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make which seems like a lot of money. <|endoftext|>
I did not know that about coaches though I guess it makes sense. I do know that the american flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make which seems like a lot of money. <|endoftext|> That is really incredible. A lot of money flows through sports and keeps players engaged. Baker Mayfield almost became a professional gamer instead of QB. It was a good thing that he wised up for all our sakes. The money is in football. <|endoftext|>
That is really incredible. A lot of money flows through sports and keeps players engaged. Baker Mayfield almost became a professional gamer instead of QB.

Yea but he could always do that after retirement instead of broadcasting like Kellan Moore does now after being the only left handed qb in the nfl <|endoftext|> I feel bad for those college players that don't have a shot at the NFL.

I love watching football and basketball, but not so much Tom Brady. I find it funny his high school team never even allowed him to play. <|endoftext|> Lol. I think most of America agrees with you. He has more super bowl wins than most teams. <|endoftext|>
Lol. I think most of America agrees with you. He has more super bowl wins than most teams. <|endoftext|> For sure. I always found it curious that the whole point of the huddle was to help a deaf quarterback communicate without the opposing team seeing his signals. <|endoftext|>
For sure. I always found it curious that the whole point of the huddle was to help a deaf quarterback communicate without the opposing team seeing his signals. <|endoftext|> I know, how cool to have something you did to help you out stick and be a big part of the game.

No doubt! Or they could have used Alex Jones - he was smart enough he took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and then became the number one draft pick! <|endoftext|> That is certainly a lot of classes, he even worked to a masters degree while staying to play. <|endoftext|>
That is certainly a lot of classes, he even worked to a masters degree while staying to play. <|endoftext|> Yes. He is amazing. Its funny - in baseball being left-handed can be an asset, but there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL. <|endoftext|>
Yes. He is amazing. Its funny - in baseball being left-handed can be an asset, but there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL. <|endoftext|> That is certainly surprising, I wonder why more left handed people don't play the position? <|endoftext|>

I wonder that as well! But I think it's surprising they've been playing home games at Lambeau Field since 1957. That's a very long time! <|endoftext|> Yes that is very historic. They have sold out every game in that place since 1960! <|endoftext|>
Yes that is very historic. They have sold out every game in that place since 1960! <|endoftext|> That is unbelievable!

I think in our blow-out they let the clock run continuously even after incomplete passes. Did you watch the 2 of the 32 NFL teams square of in the Super Bowl last Sunday? <|endoftext|>

Yes, but if they are professional, I think the ballet company pays for the shoes. Do you prefer functional shoes or decorative fashionable shoes, or both? <|endoftext|> I'm a mixture of both.

Not so easy to settle a new country. <|endoftext|>
Yes. I wish I was there. That was a great enticement for people to come from Europe. But it was hard living in those days. Not so easy to settle a new country. <|endoftext|> No. It was very hard.

I did not, it seems like they have a good relationship, thats great they are rivals but no need to fight <|endoftext|> I think it's a pretty well-shared opinion in the cartoon world that Family Guy is a lazy show because so much of its humor is non-sequiturs. Have you ever watched Pokemon? <|endoftext|>
I think it's a pretty well-shared opinion in the cartoon world that Family Guy is a lazy show because so much of its humor is non-sequiturs. Have you ever watched Pokemon? <|endoftext|> I have, got to catch them all right? seems a bit impossible at this point <|endoftext|>

Yeah, I think he is too stuborn and does whatever he wants. His guest house is larger than the white house its hard to believe he's not on that list <|endoftext|> I guess it's kind of ironic that a man who owns all those hotels lives in a house smaller than his guest house haha.

Yes, The President Show on Comedy Central actually had a Christmas special that featured a fake Trump holiday album. If he didn't spend so much time on Twitter, maybe he could release 3 albums like the president of Indonesia has while in office <|endoftext|> That would be a great idea I might buy the album and maybe Trump will make it to the top 3 rank with the money of the sales <|endoftext|>
That would be a great idea I might buy the album and maybe Trump will make it to the top 3 rank with the money of the sales <|endoftext|> Yes, that would be one way to make money.

That is ironic lol, and I hope Trump doesn't get re-elected. I really don't understand why people vote for him. <|endoftext|> I hope not! The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana, and based on the little I've read about him it seems like he wasn't a very effective leader and the country is still negatively impacted by his time in office. <|endoftext|>

what do you mean? <|endoftext|> I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as "cold readings" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again. <|endoftext|>

Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky <|endoftext|> There's this practice called "Treasure Hunting" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called "The Ultimate Treasure Hunt" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love. <|endoftext|>

I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies <|endoftext|> it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature <|endoftext|>

I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too.

I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh? <|endoftext|> Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends.

Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do. <|endoftext|> I see.

Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel? <|endoftext|> It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places.

Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts 🙂 I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing. <|endoftext|> Yeah. Some people underestimate the importance of planning, but I think it's very important to have the correct plan. Executing the wrong plan is terrible. Also, planning is fun. You can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks. <|endoftext|>

Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress? <|endoftext|> I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made? <|endoftext|>
I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made? <|endoftext|> Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature. <|endoftext|>
Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature. <|endoftext|> Ah, good thought, thanks! <|endoftext|>
Ah, good thought, thanks! <|endoftext|> Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better. <|endoftext|>
Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better. <|endoftext|> Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time.

Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth? <|endoftext|> Yes. When my top favorite food looks like <|endoftext|>
Yes. When my top favorite food looks like <|endoftext|> Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it. <|endoftext|>
Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it. <|endoftext|> Yeah I'm afraid I wouldn't. I feel very guilty every time I gulp down an ice cream. But hey, these days there are many types of guilt-free sweet food. For example, there's this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. It's only 320 calories a pint. And yes, it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors. <|endoftext|>

Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets. <|endoftext|> Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically, we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar. <|endoftext|>

Does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand? <|endoftext|> It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things.

I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental. Would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background? <|endoftext|>
